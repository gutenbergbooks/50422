<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Not long after the close of the war a plan was proposed,
by some of the officers of the regiment, for the preparation
of a history of the Thirty-sixth Regiment of Massachusetts
Volunteers; but the plan was not carried into execution.
At the regimental reunions, in subsequent years, parts of such
a history were read by Comrades White, Ranlett, and Hodgkins,
and the desire for a complete history of the regiment,
which found expression on these occasions, was so strong
that, at the reunion of the regiment at Worcester, in September,
1876, a committee, consisting of Comrades White,
Ranlett, Burrage, and Hodgkins, was appointed to procure
materials for a history of the regiment.</p>

<p>Some progress was made by the committee in the performance
of the work thus assigned to them; but it was not so
great as they, or their comrades of the Thirty-sixth, desired.
At the reunion, September 2, 1879, the matter was again considered,
and it was finally voted, "that Comrades White,
Ranlett, Hodgkins, Burrage, and Noyes, be chosen a committee
to have charge of the compiling, revising, and printing
the history of the regiment, to be ready for delivery at
our next reunion; and that the committee have power to
procure any help they may need."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Many difficulties were encountered in the progress of the
work, and it was found that it would be impossible to prepare,
within the limit of time prescribed, such a history as
would be worthy of the regiment. The different members
of the committee, amid the activities of busy lives, could
give to the work only such intervals of leisure as they could
find amid their daily tasks. At the annual reunions of
1880, 1881, and 1882,&mdash;testing the patience of their comrades
who had entrusted to them this important task,&mdash;they were
compelled to report progress only. In September, 1883,&mdash;the
last reunion,&mdash;however, they were able to say that the
work was already in press, and would be ready for delivery
in the course of a few weeks.</p>

<p>In the table of contents will be found the names of the authors
of the different chapters. The work of Comrades White,
Ranlett, Olin, and Noyes, entitles them to the hearty thanks
of all their companions in arms. Especially, however, are
such thanks due to Comrade W. H. Hodgkins, not only for his
own contribution to the history, but also for his careful attention
to the innumerable details which the preparation of such
a work required. Indeed, without his unwearied endeavors
in gathering materials, securing the coöperation of others,
and attending to the business of publication, the history would
not so soon, and might never, have been completed.</p>

<p>To the writer of these lines was assigned the editorial
supervision of the work. From the materials placed in his
hands he arranged the history of the regiment as it now
appears. Two proofs of the entire work have passed under
his eye, and in this part of his task he has had the invaluable
assistance of Major Hodgkins. The history, of course, is
not free from errors of statement; and it will doubtless be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
found that there are omissions which the writers of the different
chapters, as well as their comrades, will deeply deplore.
Yet, with all its imperfections, this volume is believed to be
substantially a faithful history of the part which the regiment
had in the great conflict for the preservation of the
National Union, which was waged during the years 1862-1865;
and, as such, it is certainly a history of which all
those who participated in it may well be proud.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIMENT.</h2>


<p>Early in July, 1862, when the war of the rebellion had
been in progress a little more than a year, President Lincoln
issued an order for three hundred thousand volunteers, to
serve three years, or during the war. It was a time of sore
discouragement and general depression throughout the loyal
States. Our army in Virginia, under General McClellan,
during a seven days' fight near the Chickahominy, had met
with such reverses that it had been compelled to "make a
change of base," and fall back to the James river, near
Harrison's Landing. Nobly, however, and cheerfully, did
the people of the North respond to the President's call for
reinforcements. On every hand was heard the chorus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"We're coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more."
</p>

<p>Massachusetts was not behind her sister States in raising
her quota, which was fifteen thousand men. In a general
order, dated July 7, 1862, Governor Andrew announced the
call which had been made upon him by the President, stated
the number of men which every city and town would be required
to furnish, and closed with these words: "The gov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>ernment
demands new regiments, and our brave men who have
so nobly upheld the honor of Massachusetts call loudly from
the battle-fields of the South to their brethren at home to
come forward at once and fill their decimated ranks, and
take the places of the brave men who have fallen and suffered
in the cause of the Union and of American Constitutional
Liberty." Like the blast of a trumpet this order stirred the
hearts of the people in all parts of the state, and cities and
towns vied with each other, in patriotic endeavors to hurry
forward the work of enlistment.</p>

<p>A subsequent order, dated July 16, 1862, containing
instructions relative to the new recruitment, designated
Camp John E. Wool, at the city of Worcester, as the general
rendezvous for the counties of Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden,
Hampshire, and Worcester. Colonel George H. Ward,
of the Fifteenth Massachusetts Volunteers, who had lost a leg
at the battle of Ball's Bluff, and was now at home on account
of disability, was placed in command of the camp.</p>

<p>The order of July 7th contained this announcement: "The
new regiments now partly formed, and to be formed, are the
Thirty-second, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-sixth, and Thirty-seventh. To complete these regiments
to the maximum standard, the Thirty-second regiment
requires 300 men; the Thirty-third, 650 men; the Thirty-fourth,
800 men; and the Thirty-fifth, 850 men." It was
accordingly ordered that recruiting for the Thirty-sixth and
Thirty-seventh regiments should not commence until the four
first named were filled. The order, however, was not
strictly observed.</p>

<p>The first detachment for the Thirty-sixth entered Camp
Wool August 1st, and was a part of the quota of the town of
Fitchburg. This detachment consisted of sixty-four men,
under the command of Captain T. L. Barker. Recruits for the
regiment had been received at Camp Wool previous to August
1st; but this was the first organized company in camp, and, in
the organization of the regiment, it was assigned to the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the line, and known as Company A. As early as August 6th
this company had its minimum number of recruits; and, in a
few days, others, from Fitchburg, Leominster, and adjacent
towns, raised the number to the maximum.</p>

<p>Company B, Captain John B. Norton, was recruited in
Charlestown during the month of July. It was at first
intended that this company should be attached to the
Thirty-fourth Regiment as a flank company, and the officers
at first received commissions in that regiment; but the
requisite authority for such a company could not be obtained
at the War Department, and the company was transferred to
the Thirty-sixth, and the officers recommissioned. For a
time, very naturally, it was a disappointment to the members
of this company that they could not remain in the Thirty-fourth;
but of the survivors there is, doubtless, not one who
is not satisfied that the record of the company was made with
the Thirty-sixth.</p>

<p>Recruiting for Company C was commenced in the city of
Worcester, August 8th, and on the 12th the company was
full. Eight days after, under the command of Captain
Arthur A. Goodell, the company entered Camp Wool. No
other company in the regiment was raised in so brief a space
of time.</p>

<p>Company D was recruited principally in the towns of
Templeton and Winchendon. The first detachment entered
Camp Wool, August 4, under the command of Captain Amos
Buffum, of Baldwinville, late second lieutenant in the
Twenty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers. In a few days the
ranks of this company were full.</p>

<p>The men of Company E were recruited from the towns
of Palmer, Monson, and the western towns of Worcester
County. The first detachment entered Camp Wool, August
10th, under the command of First Lieutenant R. M. Cross.
Captain S. C. Warriner, who had been discharged from the
Tenth Massachusetts Volunteers, in order to accept a captain's
commission in the Thirty-sixth, arrived in camp about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
20th of August, and assumed command of the company, and
completed its organization.</p>

<p>Company F was formed principally of recruits from
Milford and vicinity, with a detachment from Sutton. The
first detachment arrived at Camp Wool August 10th, under the
command of Second Lieutenant A. S. Tuttle. He remained
in command of the company until September 17, when Captain
William F. Draper, promoted from first lieutenant in
the Twenty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers, joined the regiment
then in the field, and assumed command of the company.</p>

<p>Company G was organized from unassigned recruits,
representing the eastern towns of Worcester County. S.
Henry Bailey, of Northboro', was commissioned captain of
the company August 22d.</p>

<p>Company H was formed by adding to the quotas of Gardner
and Orange the unassigned recruits then in camp; and
Christopher Sawyer, of Templeton, who had entered Camp
Wool as first sergeant of Company D, was commissioned
captain of this company August 22d.</p>

<p>Company I was recruited in Berlin, Marlboro', Upton,
Uxbridge, and adjoining towns, and entered Camp Wool in
the early part of August, under the command of Captain
Christopher Hastings, of Berlin. The company was filled to
the maximum a few days after entering camp. Indeed,
Captain Hastings recruited men enough nearly to fill two
companies.</p>

<p>Company K, like G and H, was formed of unassigned
recruits from the various towns whose quotas reported at
Camp Wool. James B. Smith, late first lieutenant in the
Twenty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers, was commissioned
captain of the company.</p>

<p>On the 27th of August these ten companies, constituting
the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts Volunteers, having completed
their organization, were mustered into the United States
service, for three years, unless sooner discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The field, staff, and line officers were not mustered into
the service until September 2d, the day the regiment left
Camp Wool for the seat of war. Indeed, for the most part,
the field officers were not appointed until after the mustering
in of the regiment.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel John W. Kimball, of Fitchburg, then
serving in the Fifteenth Regiment,&mdash;a true and accomplished
officer,&mdash;was commissioned colonel of the Thirty-sixth,
August 11th, and application was made by Governor Andrew
for his discharge from the Fifteenth, in order to accept promotion.
But, in the critical state of affairs at that time, it
was not deemed advisable by the authorities at Washington
to grant the governor's request. Consequently, on the 22d
of August, Major Henry Bowman, of the Thirty-fourth regiment,
then at Camp Casey, on Arlington Heights, was promoted
to the colonelcy of the Thirty-sixth; and, receiving his
discharge from the Thirty-fourth, he at once joined his
command at Camp Wool.</p>

<p>Captain John B. Norton, of Charlestown, who entered
Camp Wool as captain of Company B, was commissioned
lieutenant-colonel, August 28th, and on the same day, James
H. Barker, of Milford, was commissioned major.</p>

<p>James P. Prince, of Lynn, was commissioned surgeon, with
Warren Tyler, of North Brookfield, and Albert H. Bryant, of
Natick, as assistant-surgeons. Rev. Charles T. Canfield, of
Worcester, was commissioned chaplain, and F. B. Rice, also
of Worcester, as first lieutenant and quartermaster. An
adjutant was not appointed until a later date.</p>

<p>The regiment was now nearly ready for the field. Most of
the men had been hurried into camp, with the promise of a
few days' furlough before leaving the State. Many of them
had left their business affairs unsettled and their families
unprovided for. But all applications for furlough were
denied by the United States officer at Boston, who was in
charge of mustered regiments. Colonel Ward endeavored to
secure a furlough for the men; but his efforts proved unavail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ing.
Colonel Bowman, on joining the regiment, and learning
the condition of affairs, renewed these efforts, stating his
unwillingness to leave the State until the pledge which had
been given to the men had, in a measure at least, been
redeemed.</p>

<p>On Saturday, August 30th, Colonel Bowman received orders
to have the Thirty-sixth Regiment ready to leave for Washington
as early as September 2d. At the same time he was
given permission to grant to his men furloughs for twenty-four
hours, one-half of the regiment only to be absent from
camp at the same time. This order was not received by Colonel
Bowman until late Saturday afternoon. Accordingly, furloughs
were granted first of all to those men whose homes were at the
greatest distance from the camp. These were to return
Monday morning, when the rest of the men would receive
their furloughs. This second half of the regiment, by some
mysterious process, became very small Saturday evening and
on Sunday. The sentinels paced their beats, but in some
instances so absorbed in their duties as seemingly to have
lost the sense both of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>A sergeant, with a comrade, making the rounds of his
guard late on one of these nights, found a faithful son of
Erin walking his beat with soldier-like precision. As they
approached he promptly challenged: "Who goes there?"
and was as quickly answered, "Friend, with the countersign."
As they approached to give the countersign, the sergeant
asked, in confiding tones, "Could anyone get out here?"
The sentinel, as confidingly, asked, "Would ye bring a little
whiskey? Be jabbers a pint of whiskey might make a man
both blind and <em>dafe</em>!" He then turned his back, and
marched away.</p>

<p>But while it was a great disappointment to the men to lose
the few days' furlough which had been promised to them, and
especially to those who had important business interests that
demanded attention, leading in some cases to a seeming disregard
of discipline, yet all of the companies were in camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
on Tuesday morning. At an early hour on that day the
company commanders drew arms (Enfield rifles) and equipments
for their men, and these were at once distributed
among them. All was bustle and confusion throughout the
camp. Few of the men had had any experience as soldiers,
and the selection and adjustment of their arms and equipments,
as well as the brief space of time allotted for these
and other preparations for moving, made it look still more
difficult and annoying.</p>

<p>Late in the forenoon the regimental line was formed, and
a beautiful national flag was presented to the regiment by
Honorable P. Emory Aldrich, Mayor of Worcester. In
presenting the flag the Mayor said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<em>Colonel Bowman</em>,&mdash;Your friends, and the friends of your
command in this city, have procured this beautiful banner, and
requested me to present it to you as the worthy commander
of the Thirty-sixth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers
for the war. It will be seen that its azure fold is studded with
the full constellation of stars, representing the undivided Union,
and that not one of the original stripes is omitted or erased,
showing that, however much your friends may deplore the
present unhappy condition of our distracted and bleeding
country, they still firmly believe that, when the clouds of war
that now lower upon us shall have passed away, these stars
will again shine as from a clear and cloudless sky with none
of their ancient lustre lost or obscured. And permit me to say
that this flag, still unchanged and radiant, signifies, in the
truest and highest sense, the kind of service expected of you
and this noble regiment you are about to lead from this comparatively
peaceful camp of preparation to the stern and heroic
duties of the field; that you are to aid, by force of arms, in
restoring the Union, which traitors have temporarily impaired,
and in reestablishing the supremacy of the constitution
and laws over every portion of territory lying within
the acknowledged boundaries of the Union, from the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
lakes to the gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans,
so that, when you and your brave comrades return, as we
trust you will, with this flag, soiled and rent it may be by
the smoke and leaden hail of battle,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> you shall bring it back,
not as the sign of a shattered constitution, and dissevered
Union, but as the proud emblem of a reunited and indivisible
republic, and then it shall continue to be known and
honored throughout the civilized world, and everywhere become
a free and safe passport to all men of every race who
have the right to claim protection beneath its ample folds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> "Soiled and rent," its staff shattered, this flag, which was carried by the regiment
throughout its entire period of service, is now preserved in the State House, in
Boston, with the flags of the Massachusetts regiments.</p></div>

<p>"In delivering this proud ensign of our nationality into your
hands, your friends know they are entrusting it to one who
is not only familiar with the ordinary duties of the soldier,
but to one who has been tried and not found wanting
amidst the perils and carnage of the battle-field, and who
has suffered what is more intolerable to every true soldier
than any dangers of field or camp, and that is captivity and
confinement for weary months in the loathsome prisons of the
enemy; and now, after protracted and vexatious delays,
you have but recently been relieved from your parole, so that
you can, without dishonor, enter again the military service
of your country; and, having availed yourself of the earliest
opportunity to return to avenge your own and your country's
wrongs, may a propitious Providence and all good influences
attend you, and protect you, and your command in every
hour of trial and danger.</p>

<p>"Yours is the fourth regiment which has been organized
within this enclosure, which may now very properly be
called our <i lang="la">Campus Martius</i>, and the fifth that has gone out
from our city within the last twelve months. The Fifteenth,
beginning its brilliant career at Ball's Bluff,&mdash;where, indeed, it
encountered a repulse for which neither its officers nor men were
responsible,&mdash;has with signal gallantry fought its way over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>many a bloody field to a high position on the roll of fame.
And the Twenty-first and Twenty-fifth, being with each
other in the performance of patriotic duty, and in the
memorable race for military renown, have made Roanoke
and Newberne, and other fields, wherein they have exhibited
the highest qualities of the soldier, ever memorable both to
friend and foe. And it is not altogether improbable that the
Thirty-fourth, which took up its line of march but a few
days since from this camp, under the accomplished Wells,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
may have already found itself involved in the smoke of its first
battle, and taking its first lesson in the art of war. And
scarcely will your regiment have left our presence, before
another will encamp within the limits of the city. And we
bid you tell our brethren in the field that thus shall regiment
after regiment, in endless succession, be sent to their aid
until this accursed rebellion is utterly extinguished.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Colonel Wells was killed near Cedar Creek, Va., Oct. 13, 1864.</p></div>

<p>"The lateness of the hour, the necessity of your moving
at once, admonish me that I should omit a portion of what
I had proposed to say on this occasion; but this is of little
account, and I would not delay your march for a single
moment to listen to any poor words of mine. Words in
this hour are simply air. Action&mdash;instant, resistless,
heroic action&mdash;is the only thing that can avail us in this
perilous crisis. And I can only add that, while you and
these brave men who are to follow you, will do your full
duty in upholding and restoring the authority of the
constitution and its laws, you can never fail in loyalty, and
the great idea of liberty which now inspires the hearts and
nerves the hands of all the loyal men of the land; and
that, when you have marched through rebel districts, none
but loyal and <em>free men</em> shall be found. And now accept this
standard, proffered by friendly hands, and let it be borne
in your regiment as the emblem of liberty and law. And
should you or any of those, your comrades in arms, fall in its
defence, your memories shall be held in grateful remembrance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>and history will preserve their names among those
of heroes and martyrs who have died to defend or consecrate
a great and noble cause. Remember that the life is longest
which best answers life's great end, and that to die upon the
battle-field in defence of the liberties of mankind is the
most cherished road to immortality."</p></div>

<p>The band played the "Star-Spangled Banner," and
Colonel Bowman responded in patriotic terms.</p>

<p>The several companies of the regiment then marched to
Agricultural Hall,&mdash;a large building on the camp ground,&mdash;where
a bountiful collation had been provided by the friends
of the regiment. Then followed the filling of haversacks,
the packing of knapsacks, and all were soon in readiness for
the order to move.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

TO THE FRONT.</h2>


<p>There was no delay. At noon, Tuesday, September 2d,
the assembly was sounded, the line was formed, and the Thirty-sixth,
with a large number of the friends of the regiment,
who had come to say a long and perhaps a last farewell, left
Camp Wool amid the cheers of a great throng of people assembled
along the line of march to witness the departure of
the regiment, and moved up Highland street, through Main
street, to the Common. There cars were in waiting. These
were soon filled, the horses and baggage were taken aboard,
the last farewells were spoken, and, about two o'clock, followed
by the loud cheers of the multitude, and the waving of
adieus, the long train drew out of the station, and hurried
toward Boston. On the arrival of the regiment in Boston
the line was again formed, and the Thirty-sixth, receiving a
brilliant ovation from the citizens, marched through Washington
street, down State street to Battery wharf, where the
steamer "Merrimac," a new and large ocean steamer, was
in readiness to receive us. One-half of the steamer had been
assigned to the Twentieth Maine, Colonel Adelbert Ames,
and his regiment was already on board, having arrived from
Portland earlier in the day. In the crowded condition of
the steamer there was, necessarily, some delay in getting
the companies into the places to which they were assigned,
and also in transferring the horses and baggage; and it was
not until late in the evening that the embarkation was accomplished;
then the steamer dropped out into the stream.
Early the next morning, September 3d, the "Merrimac"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
left her anchorage and steamed down the harbor into the
bay.</p>

<p>We soon learned that our destination was Alexandria, Va.
The voyage throughout was a pleasant one, and the men of
the two regiments mingled in friendly companionship. On
the second day out, on the quarter-deck, some of the men of
Company B gave an exhibition, consisting of singing, declamations,
etc., which was greatly enjoyed by a large and
enthusiastic audience. Friday noon we reached the capes
of the Chesapeake, had a glimpse of Fortress Monroe, and,
moving up the bay, many of us looked upon the "sacred soil"
for the first time; the steamer entered the Potomac river
about ten o'clock in the evening, and shortly after midnight
came to anchor. At five o'clock Saturday morning we again
were under way, and had a most delightful sail up the Potomac,
with both shores in full view. At length we passed
Mt. Vernon, once the home and now the grave of Washington,
and soon after, about noon, we were at the wharf in
Alexandria.</p>

<p>Here we learned that the Thirty-fourth Massachusetts, which
left Worcester August 15th, was doing guard duty and building
fortifications near Alexandria. The Twentieth Maine was
landed, but we remained on the steamer during the night.
The next morning, Sunday, September 7th, we were transferred
to the steamer "City of Norwich," in which we proceeded
up the river to Washington, and landed not far from
the Navy Yard.</p>

<p>Lee, in the last days of August, had defeated Pope within
sound of the capitol, and was now pushing his victorious
columns northward with the purpose of carrying the war into
the Union States. The forces under General McClellan,
who was again in command of the army, were also moving
northward, but through Maryland, in order to intercept Lee's
columns and give him battle. We encamped near the capitol
until September 9th, when, having been assigned to General
Burnside's command, the Ninth Corps, we left Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and marched to Leesboro'. But Burnside was no longer
there, and several days were lost in obtaining further orders.
September 12th the regiment left Leesboro' at an early hour,
and marched about twelve miles, to Brookville, near which
we went into camp on a beautiful grassy slope belonging to
the estate of Hon. John Hall, formerly of the United States
Post-Office Department. Near us was the camp of the First
Rhode Island Cavalry.</p>

<p>On Sunday, September 14th, we held our first religious
service in the field, and the chaplain preached. On that day
the distant sound of artillery was heard, and we knew that,
somewhere beyond us, the two armies had again met. It was
the day of the battle of South Mountain, in which General
Burnside, it will be remembered, gained an important battle,
carrying the mountain pass which Lee had directed his forces
to hold "at every hazard."</p>

<p>On Monday, September 15th, Colonel Bowman received
from a mounted orderly a note written in pencil, which purported
to be an order from General McClellan, signed "R.
B. Marcy, Chief of Staff," directing all troops on the road to
hurry forward as rapidly as possible. Colonel Bowman
doubted the genuineness of this hasty scrawl, and the more
so on account of the appearance of suspicious persons about
the camp the night before. Not knowing the result of the
battle of the previous day, and afraid that an attempt might
be made to capture his regiment in its isolated position, he
decided not to move his command until he received further
instructions or had better information concerning the state of
affairs at the front. This delay undoubtedly prevented our
participation in the battle of Antietam, which was fought
September 17th. On that day, having learned that the road
was open, we left Brookville, and, moving forward rapidly,
we encamped at night about three miles beyond the village
of Damascus. On the following day we marched through
Unity, Monrovia, Newmarket, and Frederick, and encamped
about a mile beyond the latter place. During the day, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
on the march, we passed the men of Colonel Miles' command
at Harper's Ferry, who, on the 15th, were surrendered to
Stonewall Jackson and paroled,&mdash;in all, five or six regiments,
containing about five thousand men. They were now on
their way to Annapolis. It was not a pleasant sight to see
so many of our soldiers going to the rear; but they cheered
us with reports of the battle on the 17th, in which our army
was victorious.</p>

<p>September 19th we resumed the march about ten o'clock
in the forenoon, crossed the Catoctin mountains to Middletown,
enjoying the magnificent prospect at the summit, and
encamped beyond the town at the place where, on the Sunday
before, General McClellan and General Burnside had their
head-quarters during the battle of South Mountain.</p>

<p>On the following day we crossed South Mountain. Here
and there by the roadside were newly-made graves,&mdash;in one
place we counted twenty-six,&mdash;and the trees and fences bore
marks of the recent fight. We passed also long trains of
ambulance wagons, loaded with wounded men from the battle-field
at Antietam, and also many of the wounded on foot,
who were on their way to the hospitals in Frederick. Places
of interest were pointed out to us on our way. One was
the spot where, just at the close of the action on Sunday,
General Reno fell. Another was the ground where the
Thirty-fifth Massachusetts formed, and over which it made its
brilliant charge, driving the enemy from the woods beyond.</p>

<p>Descending into a valley, we passed through Boonsboro',
where was a hospital full of wounded rebels, and encamped at
Keedysville, about two miles east of the Antietam battle-ground.
Everywhere around us were the sad memories of
the terrible conflict that was waged on that hard-fought field.
Houses, barns, sheds, places of shelter of all kinds, were
filled with the wounded, and on the field where the battle was
fought, hundreds of the dead still lay unburied, although a
large force had been steadily engaged in this service since the
preceding Wednesday. Looking upon these scenes we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
brought face to face with the dread realities of war. Among
the wounded we found many friends and acquaintances who
belonged to other Massachusetts regiments, and whose sad
condition enlisted our warmest sympathies, and drew from
many the expression, "If there be glory in war, it is dearly
bought."</p>

<p>September 21st we left Keedysville in the afternoon, crossed
the famous stone bridge from which Burnside, on the 17th,
gallantly dislodged the enemy, passed through Sharpsburg,
which bore the marks of our shot and shell, and encamped a
short distance beyond, near General Burnside's head-quarters.</p>

<p>Here the Thirty-sixth was assigned to the Third Brigade of
the first division of the Ninth Corps. In the brigade were the
Forty-fifth and One Hundredth (Roundheads) Pennsylvania
regiments, to which we soon became warmly attached, and
with which we were to be associated during nearly our whole
period of service. Than these two regiments there were no
better in the Ninth Corps; and our regard for both officers
and men increased as common experiences drew us nearer
together. Indeed, they became to us almost as brothers,
and we have reason to believe that this feeling was mutual.
Colonel Welch, of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, commanded
the brigade, and General O. B. Willcox, the division.</p>

<p>September 23d, about half-past three o'clock in the morning,
there was a general alarm. "Fall in! Fall in!" resounded
through the camp, and for two hours we stood in line of
battle on the edge of an adjoining cornfield; but it was only
an alarm, and about half-past five we returned to our
quarters.</p>

<p>On the 25th we were ordered to be in readiness to march.
The tents were struck, our regimental baggage was packed,
all of our preparations for a movement were completed; but
about four o'clock in the afternoon the order was countermanded,
and we pitched our tents on our former camp ground.</p>

<p>The next morning we received orders to be ready to march
at one o'clock P.M. We were in line at that time, but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the whole corps was in motion, and we were in the rear, there
was some delay for us. It was a beautiful sight, as the
several brigades and divisions of the corps, with the long
train of baggage-wagons, moved over the hills. At length
our brigade started. We crossed Antietam Creek at Isabella
Furnace, the troops passing over the bridge, and the wagons
fording the stream. Just at sundown we encamped near
Antietam Iron Works, about five miles above Harper's Ferry.
The tents of the men were soon up, and the camp-fires
lighted. A more brilliant scene can hardly be imagined than
that presented by these fields around us, illuminated by
innumerable camp-fires.</p>

<p>By order of General Willcox, Sunday, September 29th, was
observed by the division as a day of special religious service,
to give thanks to God for our recent victories in Maryland.
The whole division was brought together, and the services
were conducted by Chaplain Canfield, of the Thirty-sixth, and
other chaplains of New York and Pennsylvania regiments.
The band first played "Old Hundred." The 46th Psalm was
then read, and a hymn sung to the well-known tune of
Balerma. Remarks were then made by four chaplains belonging
to the division. The services were very interesting and
solemn throughout. In the afternoon Chaplain Canfield
preached.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, September 30th, there was a division review
in the forenoon, and monthly regimental inspection in the
afternoon. On Friday, October 3d, the corps was reviewed
by President Lincoln and General McClellan. We formed
our regimental line at seven o'clock, then marched to a field in
the rear of our camp, and were assigned to a position on the
left of our brigade. The President arrived on the ground
shortly after nine o'clock, and passed us in review about ten.
This visit gave many in the regiment their first opportunity
to see Mr. Lincoln, and the day was one of great interest.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 7th, the Thirty-sixth experienced what
was as yet its most difficult and trying march. We had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
orders to move at daylight. The <em>reveillé</em> was sounded at three
o'clock. At half-past five we left camp. The head of the
column was toward Maryland Heights, which we were to
cross into Pleasant Valley. The road was a narrow mountain
road, in many places quite steep, and during the recent
movements it had been obstructed by fallen trees. At length
we reached the summit, where there was a magnificent view;
and then we commenced the equally difficult descent. The
day was intensely hot, and the men, completely exhausted,
fell out in large numbers, and at a halt about half-past
two, Colonel Welch ordered the roll to be called.
About four o'clock we encamped in a most delightful and
beautiful locality in Pleasant Valley, on a wooded bank,
which sloped gradually down to a clear stream of running
water, ten or twelve feet wide, near which were cool springs
of pure water sufficient for all our wants. Harper's Ferry,
above us, was about ten miles distant, and Knoxville the
same distance below us, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.</p>

<p>While the regiment was at dress parade on Saturday,
October 11th, we received orders to be ready to move immediately,
with haversack, canteen, and overcoat, and without
blankets. The line was formed at once. The guns were
loaded, and with the Forty-fifth and One Hundredth Pennsylvania,
and a section of artillery, we marched down the road
to Weverton, a little station on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
where platform cars were awaiting us. The Thirty-sixth
took a train by itself, and left the station at seven o'clock.
When the cars stopped, about midnight, we found that we
were at Frederick. Leaving the cars we marched into the
town, and were ordered to make ourselves as comfortable as
we could upon the cold sidewalks. No fires were allowed,
and it was impossible to keep warm in the chilly night air.
At six o'clock we marched to a field on the edge of the town,
where we took breakfast, and where we remained until noon,
when we took a new position on the Washington road. We
now learned the object of this movement. Stuart's cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
were on their return from a raid into Pennsylvania, and it
was supposed that they would attempt to destroy the government
stores at Frederick, of which there was a considerable
quantity. At five o'clock they were at Newmarket, eight
miles distant; and the presence of our brigade at Frederick
undoubtedly led them to turn aside. Moving toward the Potomac
they at once crossed the river, and so made their escape,
with the loss of a few prisoners brought in by our cavalry.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, while we were awaiting orders upon
the Washington road, it began to rain, and there was the
promise of a cheerless night. Just at dark we marched to
the station. The train left about seven o'clock, our destination
unknown. At length we reached Point of Rocks, where
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad strikes the Potomac. Leaving
the cars we marched up the road a short distance in the
darkness and rain, and halted. Companies A, B, and C
were advanced to picket the heights above the station. The
rest of the regiment, officers and men alike, sought shelter
wherever it could be found. The morning revealed some
of these luckless sleepers emerging from the two apologies for
houses near at hand; some from beneath them; some from
the pigsty and hen-house; many from beneath the shocks
of corn in adjacent fields; while others had made no attempt to
sleep, but had travelled about all night, stumbling over their
comrades. The line was formed, and we moved out about half a
mile, to a pleasant field near the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
and encamped. There we remained until Wednesday, October
15th, when we had orders to return to our camp in Pleasant
Valley. We left Point of Rocks at half-past ten o'clock in the
forenoon, and, following the towpath of the canal, we reached
Weverton at half-past three. After some delay in waiting for the
rest of our brigade we reached our old camp about five o'clock.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 21st, the regiment was inspected by
an officer on Gen. McClellan's staff. On Friday following
there were indications of a forward movement, which, it
seemed, could not now long be deferred.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

IN VIRGINIA.</h2>


<p>Sunday morning, October 26th, we were aroused at half-past
three o'clock, and ordered to be ready to move at
daylight. We struck our tents in a pouring rain, had breakfast,
but did not leave our camp until after seven. Then we
marched down the river to the little village of Berlin, where
a pontoon bridge had been thrown across the Potomac. There
we halted until afternoon. It was a general movement.
Not only were the regiments of our own brigade with us, but
a large number of other regiments. For hours, while the
cavalry was crossing, we were obliged to stand in a drenching
rain awaiting the crossing of the infantry, which was to follow.
At length our line was in motion, and the long column of
infantry, having reached the Virginia shore, continued the
march, dragging its weary length through the mud, ankle
deep, and such mud as only Virginia can boast. About four
o'clock, and after advancing several miles from the river, we
turned into a field which had been sown with winter wheat,
and on which the wheat was two or three inches high. A
more disagreeable and uncomfortable place could hardly have
been found; and there, in the mud, wet, cold, and weary, we
were ordered to halt, stack arms, and make ourselves comfortable
for the night. This order, however, was at length
countermanded, and the men removed to the fences and the
grassy fields adjoining. Although it was still raining, and a
cold north wind was blowing a gale, the orders were not to take
rails for fires. But there was no other wood at hand, and it
was not long before bright fires, made of the rails from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
fences around, were blazing along the whole line, and every
man was doing his best to make his condition tolerable.
For fatigue, discomfort, and vexation, that first day's experience
on Virginia soil was rarely exceeded in the history
of the regiment. It is but just to state that for the
selection of this camp the officers of the Thirty-sixth were
in no way responsible.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the next forenoon the clouds parted,
and the sun came out bright and beautiful. With warmth
and rations came good cheer to the men. On the following
day large numbers of troops joined us, and we were expecting
to move at any moment. But we remained in camp until the
next day, Wednesday, October 29th, when, about two o'clock
in the afternoon, we received orders to march. We advanced
through a beautiful country, the farms looking more like New
England farms than any we had seen; and, passing through the
village of Waterford in the early evening, we encamped a
short distance beyond the village, and about ten miles from
Snicker's Gap. Here we remained until Sunday.</p>

<p>Pleasant days were those which we spent at Waterford.
Saturday afternoon, November 1st, we had orders to be in
readiness to move on the following day. Our preparations
were made in the early morning, but we did not move until
eleven o'clock. It was a bright, sunny day, and quite warm.
We reached Hamilton about two o'clock in the afternoon;
and, after a short rest, continued our march until eight
o'clock, when we encamped in an oak grove at Philemont.
Ahead of us there was cannonading throughout the day.</p>

<p>On Monday, November 3d, we continued our march at one
P.M., our course being nearly parallel to the Blue Ridge.
At Union, Gen. Burnside passed us with his staff. At seven
o'clock we halted for the night. The next day some quartermaster's
stores were issued to the men, and one day's rations.
About noon there was heavy firing in advance of us, but still
distant. Wednesday, November 5th, the bugles sounded at
five o'clock, and we were ordered to be in readiness to march;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
but it was eight o'clock before the column moved. Heavy
firing was heard most of the forenoon. About half-past one
in the afternoon, having arrived at Manassas Gap Railroad,
we encamped a short distance beyond Rectortown. While on
this march Corporal Parker, of Company D, died in the
ambulance, probably of apoplexy. He died within sound of
cannon, yet not on the field of battle. About sunset he was
buried under a tree near our camp, his company and the officers
of the regiment following his remains to the grave. It
was the first death in the regiment; and this, with the circumstances
of his lonely burial, cast a shadow of sadness over
us all.</p>

<p>On Thursday, November 6th, we resumed our march at an
early hour. As we passed through Salem there were so many
evidences of disloyalty that the bands played Yankee Doodle
for the edification of the inhabitants. The afternoon march
was a severe one. There were few rests, and those were
short; and toward night many of the men fell out from
exhaustion. About six o'clock we encamped at Orleans.
The night that followed was intensely cold, and water froze.
In the morning, November 7th, it began to snow. At noon,
when we received orders to march, it was still snowing, and
there were two or three inches of snow on the ground. We
advanced only a few miles, and encamped on the north bank
of a branch of the Rappahannock, not far from Waterloo.</p>

<p>Late that night a special messenger from the War Department
arrived at Gen. McClellan's head-quarters, with the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, Nov. 5, 1862.</p>

<p>By direction of the President of the United States, it is ordered
that Major-General McClellan be relieved from the command of
the Army of the Potomac, and that Major-General Burnside take
command of that army.</p>

<p class="right">
By order of the Secretary of War,<br />
E. D. TOWNSEND, <em>Ass't Adj't Gen.</em><br />
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>We remained in camp on Saturday and Sunday, November
8th and 9th, suffering from the cold, and knowing nothing of
the important change thus announced. On Sunday, morning
and afternoon, special religious services were held among the
regiments of our division, by order of our commanding
general. Gen. Burnside's order, assuming command of the
Army of the Potomac, was now prepared, and was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">


<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Head-quarters Army of the Potomac</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Warrenton</span>, <span class="smcap">Va.</span>, Nov. 9, 1862.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">General Orders No. 1.</span><br /></p>

<p>In accordance with General Orders No. 182, issued by the
President of the United States, I hereby assume command of the
Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Patriotism and the exercise of my every energy in the direction
of this army, aided by the full and hearty coöperation of its officers
and men, will, I hope, under the blessing of God, ensure its
success.</p>

<p>Having been a sharer of the privations, and a witness of the
bravery, of the old Army of the Potomac in the Maryland campaign,
and fully identified in their feelings of respect and esteem
for General McClellan, entertained through a long and most friendly
association with him, I feel that it is not as a stranger that I
assume this command.</p>

<p>To the Ninth Corps, so long and intimately associated with me,
I need say nothing; our histories are identical.</p>

<p>With diffidence for myself, but with a proud confidence in the
unswerving loyalty and determination of the gallant army now
entrusted to my care, I accept its control with the steadfast assurance
that the just cause must prevail.</p>

<p class="right">
A. E. BURNSIDE,<br />
<em>Major-General Commanding</em>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This order was not received by us until Tuesday, November
11th, and while we were still in camp near Waterloo. We
shared in the general esteem in which General McClellan was
held throughout the army; but we loved Burnside, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
confidence in his ability to lead us on to victory. On this
day there was no bread for the men. Our supply-train had
been delayed, and for several days the ration for each man
was two ears of corn and a small piece of fresh meat. This
place will always be known to the survivors of the Thirty-sixth
by the suggestive name of "Hungry Hollow."</p>

<p>On Thursday, November 13th, the supply-train arrived,
and the Thirty-sixth received eight boxes of hard bread.
In the morning of that day Corporal Perry, of
Company G, died. He had been sick only since Saturday.
The burial occurred that night.</p>

<p>November 15th, while at breakfast, we received orders to
march; and, with the rest of our division, now under the
command of General W. W. Burns (Colonel Welch commanding
the brigade), we moved forward to White Sulphur
Springs,&mdash;a noted watering-place, whose buildings had been
nearly destroyed by General Sigel's troops in an engagement
with the enemy in passing through the place in August.
While on the march we heard sharp musketry ahead, and as
we approached the Springs a few shots were fired. We
accordingly left the main road, and formed in line of battle
behind a hill; but the enemy fell back, and in a little while
we received orders to go into camp.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 16th, we were aroused early with
orders to march. The teams were sent off before light, but
the regiment did not leave camp until ten o'clock. At noon
we rested at Fayetteville. The afternoon's march was a most
wearisome one; and it was not until after dark, when near
Warrenton Junction, that we halted for the night.</p>

<p>The next day, November 17th, we marched at noon, and
were four hours on the road without any rest. The whole
corps seemed to be in motion. The artillery and wagons
occupied the road, while the infantry moved in two columns,
one on each side of the road. A rainy night followed.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 18th, we were called by the bugles at
half-past three, and at quarter-past five we were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
march. At twelve we encamped, having advanced about
fourteen miles toward Fredericksburg. General Willcox,
now our corps commander, passed us on the road, and was
warmly cheered. An order was received from General
Burnside assigning the Ninth Corps to the right grand division
of the Army of the Potomac, under the command of
Major-General Sumner. General Burnside and staff encamped
near us about two o'clock.</p>

<p>November 19th we commenced our march about eight
o'clock. Private Pierce, of Company D, died just before
we left our camp, and the pioneer corps were directed to
remain and bury the body. It was a rainy, drizzly day, and
the march was a wearisome one. We had a fine view of the
camp of the Second Corps as we approached Falmouth.
About one o'clock we were opposite Fredericksburg, and
encamped in an open field, in the mud. A part of the regiment
received orders to go on picket. For two days and
nights it continued to rain, and our camp became one vast
mud-puddle.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 23d, at the regular service, the
chaplain read the Thanksgiving proclamation of Governor
Andrew to the Massachusetts soldiers in the field, and also
his proclamation to the people of the State. The day before
Thanksgiving, Wednesday, November 26th, the Ninth Corps
was reviewed by General Sumner. It had rained the night
before, and it was somewhat uncomfortable standing three
hours in mud and water waiting for the appearance of the
general. At length he passed us in review, and we were
dismissed.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 27th, was Thanksgiving. The day
opened gloriously, the sun rising unclouded. Many were
the efforts which the men made to prepare from army stores
a suitable feast for the day. About eleven o'clock, in the
midst of these efforts, we received orders to change the location
of our camp. We moved only a few hundred yards,
but to a young pine forest, which proved to be a much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
agreeable spot than that which we had hitherto occupied. The
day closed as brightly as it opened. Having arranged our
new camp, the regiment resumed daily drills, and the usual
routine of camp duty. On Friday, November 28th, we had
our first dress-parade since leaving Waterford.</p>

<p>November 30th, which was Sunday, special religious
services were held, by request of President Lincoln. In our
brigade the services were conducted by Chaplain Canfield
and the chaplain of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania. At night
Companies E and H went out on fatigue duty, and worked
on fortifications near the Lacy House. Private Sager, of
Company B, died in the regimental hospital this morning.</p>

<p>December 1st, S. Alonzo Ranlett, orderly sergeant of
Company B, was commissioned first lieutenant, and subsequently
was appointed adjutant of the regiment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Lee was fortifying the heights back of
Fredericksburg; and on the part of our soldiers there was
not a little of impatience expressed at General Burnside's
delay in advancing upon the enemy. This delay, however,
could not be avoided, on account of the necessity of opening
communications with Aquia Creek, and also of procuring
pontoons with which to cross the river. Indeed, the preparations
for the movement upon the enemy, urgent as General
Burnside was, were not completed until December 10th. On
that day the Thirty-sixth received orders to be ready to
move. At night, the Stafford Heights, and the left bank of
the Rappahannock opposite Fredericksburg, were occupied by
one hundred and forty-seven pieces of artillery; and before
dawn our pontoniers were busily employed in preparations
for laying five bridges, upon which the troops were to cross.</p>

<p>The Thirty-sixth was early in line on the morning of the
11th, and, with the brigade, moved down toward the river,
and there remained during the rest of the day, while the
attempt was made to lay the bridges under cover of our
artillery. But the workmen near the Lacy House were
greatly hindered in their efforts by sharp-shooters advanta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>geously
posted on the opposite bank of the river; and a
terrific shelling of the city did not succeed in dislodging them.
At length, from the regiments near at hand, volunteers were
summoned to cross the river in boats, and drive the rebel sharp-shooters
from their position. Men from the Seventh Michigan,
Nineteenth and Twentieth Massachusetts, answered the
summons; and with men from the Fiftieth New York, as boatmen,
crossed the river. Then, darting up the bank, in a few
minutes they compelled the enemy to withdraw. The work
of laying the pontoons was soon pushed rapidly forward,
and late in the afternoon the bridges were completed. The
army then began to cross, Lee being unable to oppose its
advance on account of the commanding position afforded our
batteries by the Stafford Heights. Franklin's grand division
crossed below the city, and formed the left wing
of the army. Sumner's crossed at the upper bridges, and
formed the right wing. Hooker's grand division was held
in reserve on the northern bank of the river, ready to reinforce
either Sumner or Franklin. Most of the troops crossed
on the 12th. That morning the several divisions of the
Ninth Corps were early in line; and, as they reached the
Fredericksburg side of the river, they were placed in position
on the left of Sumner's grand division, and just below
the city. In the crossing, a few men were killed or wounded
by the enemy's shells that fell short of our batteries, at which
they were aimed. Two men of the Thirty-sixth were in
this way slightly wounded.</p>

<p>That night we moved up into the city, and, stacking arms
in the street, spent the night on the sidewalk and in the deserted
houses in rear of the guns. Early in the morning of
December 13th preparations were made for the approaching
battle. Burns' division of the Ninth Corps, to which our
brigade belonged, was assigned to a position below the city.
There, across Hazel Run, behind a rise of ground, we remained
under arms in reserve, listening to the roar of artillery
and musketry as the battle raged along the line from left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
right, expecting every minute to be called to participate in
the terrible conflict; but no orders came until afternoon, when
we moved further down the river, crossed Deep Run, and
were placed in position in front of the Barnard House, covering
the lower pontoon bridge. At dark the Thirty-sixth
moved forward, and supported a battery in front of the Sligo
House.</p>

<p>During the day General Meade, with his division, won a
temporary success on the left, but was at length compelled
to fall back, for the want of adequate support. In rear of
the city the divisions of French, Hancock, and Humphrey
successively endeavored to carry Marye's Heights, but were
repulsed with great loss. General Burnside was greatly disappointed
at the result of the day's fighting. It seemed to
him that there was lack of spirited leadership, and he accordingly
determined to renew the battle early in the morning,
and lead his old corps, the Ninth, in person, in an assault on
Marye's Heights, with the right and left vigorously supporting.
In reference to this proposed attack, Colonel Leasure
of the One Hundredth Pennsylvania, who commanded our
brigade, says: "I received an order, through General Burns,
from General Willcox, stating that the Ninth Corps would
assault the enemy's works on the next day, and that my
brigade, the Third, would lead the attack; and I was requested
to submit a plan of attack, subject to the approval of the
commanding general. Consequently, I submitted the following:
I would advance my own regiment, the One Hundredth
Pennsylvania, or Roundheads, in the darkness of night, as close
as possible to the enemy's works, as skirmishers and sharp-shooters,
supporting them as nearly as possible with the remainder
of my brigade,&mdash;the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania and
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts,&mdash;which, in turn, were to be supported
by the remainder of the division and the other divisions
of the corps. In the gray of the morning the One Hundredth
should advance suddenly, driving in the enemy's pickets, or
capturing them, and as much as possible pick off their gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ners,
then charge their works in the confusion, throwing in
brigade after brigade. This plan was sent to General Burns
as the one most feasible; but with it went my most solemn
protest against the inevitable destruction of my brigade if it
should be adopted, and it was sent to General Burnside with
the protest endorsed on it by the commanding officer of the
corps and also by General Sumner. But, notwithstanding,
it was early morning before the assault was abandoned."
In fact, the Third Brigade took position at the front in
accordance with the above plan, the Thirty-sixth, with the
Forty-fifth on its right, being in line of battle behind a steep,
wooded bank, above which, in the early dawn, the outlines of
the enemy's works were plainly visible. The One Hundredth
was well up toward the enemy's lines, lying low.
And here we remained on our arms, expecting every moment
to charge the rebel works on the left of the open field, where
so many of our brave comrades had fallen the day before,
when, unexpectedly to all, we were ordered back to our old
position below the city. At daylight, after rations were
issued, our whole division moved up to the city, where the
Ninth Corps was massed in five lines, near the river. No
further advance was made, and there we remained throughout
the day. At night we moved back again to our old
position below the city, where we remained during the night
and all the next day.</p>

<p>It is easy to criticise General Burnside's plan of battle. It
is plain, however, that, if our soldiers had carried Marye's
Heights, Burnside could not have occupied them, as they are
commanded by still higher ground in their rear. But it
should be remembered that General Burnside designed that
the weight of his assault, December 13th, should fall upon
General Lee's right, and his mistake seems to have been that
his force at that point was not greatly increased, and placed
under the command of an officer from whom he could expect
the most hearty support.</p>

<p>About dark on the 15th we were again in line. The One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Hundredth Pennsylvania and the Second Michigan, old and
tried regiments, were ordered out, while the Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania and the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts remained
under arms awaiting orders. To secure strict silence, the
men were not to speak, and to avoid coughing as much as
possible. This, together with the ominous injunction of
Colonel Leasure to his old regiment, as they joined him:
"Now do your duty, Roundheads," was interpreted as meaning
serious work near at hand. About ten o'clock in the
evening the rest of our brigade moved up into the city
quietly, where, to our surprise, we found the place was nearly
deserted, there being in the streets, at this point, only one
regiment, the Eighty-ninth New York, and that had just been
withdrawn from the picket-line. Several batteries were near
the river, limbered up and all ready to move. The Thirty-sixth
relieved the Eighty-ninth New York, and waited for the One
Hundredth Pennsylvania, which was on the extreme front of
the picket-line. So we were among the last troops to leave
the city. We crossed unharmed, and returned to our old
camp, back of the Phillips House, on the morning of December
16, sharing, with the rest of the army, the disappointment
that was felt on account of the repulse and the serious
losses sustained by many of our regiments, yet feeling that,
while the fruitless task that was assigned to others had not
fallen to our lot, we had done all that was required of us as
faithful soldiers.</p>

<p>On the 17th general inspection was ordered. The Thirty-sixth
mustered about six hundred and fifty guns. Of the
remaining three hundred and fifty of our comrades who left
Massachusetts with us, quite a large number were detailed
on special duty, many were on the sick-list, and ten had
died.</p>

<p>As soon as the men had arranged their quarters, and with
as much comfort as they were able, the usual round of camp
and picket duty was resumed. The pickets of both armies
had hitherto been very friendly, and they now became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
friendly than ever, often exchanging courtesies, and chatting
freely on matters pertaining to the war. Many of the soldiers
received boxes from home, and there were a few Massachusetts
visitors at our camp.</p>

<p>January 16th orders were received to be ready to move the
next day, at an early hour, with three days' rations, and sixty
rounds of ammunition. It was also announced that General
Sedgwick had been assigned to the command of the Ninth
Corps. The following day was clear and cold, but there were
no orders to move. Nor were any received on the 18th, and
we had a quiet Sunday. On Monday, too, all was quiet on
the Rappahannock. At noon on Tuesday, January 20,
however, orders came for us to be in readiness to move early
the next morning. It was now evident that another movement
was to be made across the river. General Hooker's and
General Franklin's grand divisions of the army were already
in motion in our rear. At dress parade that night, an order
from General Burnside was read by Colonel Bowman to the
regiment, informing us that the Army of the Potomac was
about to meet the enemy once more, and calling upon officers
and men to coöperate with him in securing a victory. When
the order had been read, three cheers were given for our
commanding general. Just at night a cold, north-east storm
set in, the wind increased to a gale, and the rain fell in
torrents. Late in the evening orders came for the Thirty-sixth
to be ready to move at three o'clock the next morning,
January 21st. At that time the men were in line, and remained
standing four hours in the drenching rain, with the mud ankle-deep.
At about ten o'clock the regiment was ordered on
picket. The storm continued through the day. Tuesday,
January 22d, it was still raining, and the mud deeper than
ever. Hooker and Franklin were literally "stuck in the
mud." Artillery caissons, guns, ambulances, and army
wagons were immovable. To go forward was impossible;
and finally, from sheer necessity, all hope of further advance
was abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus again was Burnside compelled to witness the defeat
of his plans. Never did the Army of the Potomac suffer
more severely, and never was experience more demoralizing
than during these three days of constant exposure to wet
and cold, in midwinter, without shelter of any kind.
Weary and disheartened, the men of Franklin's grand division
struggled back to camp, singly or in squads. Many had
thrown away everything but haversack and canteen, and
curses on everything and everybody filled the air. It is said
that the army in Flanders swore terribly. So did the
demoralized soldiers of the Army of the Potomac as they
struggled back to their old camp.</p>

<p>In the meantime the rebels appeared on the opposite bank
of the river, greatly elated at the discomfiture of our army,
and amused themselves by offering to come over and extricate
our men from the mud, to aid them in crossing, and to show
them around on the other side.</p>

<p>A few days of sun, rations, and rest, however, brought about
a better state of feeling among our men; and the Army of the
Potomac settled back into its old quarters, and resumed the
usual routine of duty.</p>

<p>Now there followed another change in commanders. General
Burnside had become convinced not only that he did not
have the coöperation of a large number of his subordinate
officers of high rank, but that some of them were doing all in
their power to thwart his plans. He accordingly prepared an
order dismissing from the service Generals Hooker, Brooks,
Cochrane and Newton, and relieving from their commands,
Generals Franklin, W. F. Smith, Sturgis, Ferrero, and Col.
Taylor. Proceeding to Washington, he asked the President
to approve of this order or to accept his resignation. The
President referred the order to his military advisers, who
declined to recommend its approval. Accordingly, unwilling
to accept his resignation, the President relieved General
Burnside of the command of the Army of the Potomac,
and not long after assigned him to the command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Department of the Ohio. General Hooker was made General
Burnside's successor, and the change was announced to the
army January 26th.</p>

<p>In taking leave of the army Gen. Burnside issued the
following order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

<span class="smcap">Head-quarters Army of the Potomac</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Falmouth, Va.</span>, Jan. 26th, 1863.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">General Orders No. 9.</span><br />
</p>

<p>By direction of the President of the United States, the commanding
general this day transfers the command of the army to
Major-General Joseph Hooker.</p>

<p>The short time that he has directed your movements has not been
fruitful of victory or any considerable advancement of our lines;
but it has again demonstrated an amount of courage, patience, and
endurance that, under more favorable circumstances, would have
accomplished great results. Continue to exercise these virtues, be
true in your devotion to your country and the principles you have
sworn to maintain, give to the brave and skilful general who has
so long been identified with your organization, and who is now to
command you, your full and cordial support and coöperation, and
you will deserve success.</p>

<p>In taking an affectionate leave of the entire army, from which
he separates with so much regret, he may be pardoned if he bids
an especial farewell to his long-time associates of the Ninth Corps.</p>

<p>His prayers are that God may be with you, and grant your
continual success until the rebellion is crushed.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's letter to General Hooker, informing the latter
of his appointment, did credit alike to the President's head
and heart, and is worthy of a place here:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<em>Major-General Hooker</em>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of
course I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient
reasons. And yet I think it best for you to know that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.
I believe you to be a brave and skilful soldier, which, of course, I
like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession,
in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a
valuable, if not an indispensable, quality. You are ambitious,
which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm.
But I think that, during General Burnside's command of the army,
you have taken counsel of your ambition, and thwarted him as
much as you could, in which you did a great wrong both to the
country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer.
I have heard, in such way as to believe it, of your recently saying
that both the army and the government needed a dictator. Of
course it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you
the command. Only those generals who gain successes can set up
dictators. What I now ask of you is military success, and I will
risk the dictatorship. The government will support you to the
utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has
done and will do for all commanders. I much fear the spirit you
have aided to infuse into the army, of criticising their commander
and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I
shall assist you, as far as I can, to put it down. Neither you nor
Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an
army while such a spirit prevails in it. And now, beware of
rashness! beware of rashness! but, with energy and sleepless
vigilance, go forward and give us victories.</p>

<p class="right">
Yours, very truly,<br />

</div>

<p>January 27th we received General Hooker's address to the
army, also General Sumner's farewell, he having been relieved
of the command of the right grand division at his
own request. January 29th, our Major, James H. Barker, also
at his own request, received an honorable discharge, and on
the following day he left for his home in Massachusetts.
He was a faithful officer, a man of sterling integrity, of upright
life, and his departure we greatly regretted.</p>

<p>On Thursday, February 5th, we received orders for the
Ninth Corps to proceed forthwith to Fortress Monroe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
under General Smith. On the following day the Third
Division took cars for Aquia Creek. On Sunday, February
8th, General Willcox assumed command of the First
Division, General Burns having been ordered West. In the
afternoon Colonel Ward, of the Fifteenth Massachusetts, who
was in command of Camp Wool during the organization of the
Thirty-sixth, visited our camp, and was cordially greeted by
officers and men. February 10th, about noon, orders came
for us to pack up and be ready to move immediately. At
ten o'clock we marched to the station, the Thirty-sixth leading
the brigade. The cars left at five o'clock, and at half-past
six we were at Aquia Creek, where we embarked on
steamer "South America." About eight o'clock the next
morning we started down the Potomac; but, on account of a
storm, the captain found it necessary to anchor in the middle
of the afternoon at the mouth of the St. Mary's river. The
next morning we started again; and at night, just at dark,
we arrived off Fortress Monroe, and anchored. Early the
next morning Colonel Bowman went ashore with the captain
of the steamer, and reported our arrival. On their return,
about ten o'clock, we weighed anchor, passed the steam-frigate
"Minnesota" and the iron-clad "Nahant," and landed
at Newport News, a few miles above. About the middle of
the afternoon we went into camp about a mile and a half from
the landing, and on a high bluff overlooking the James river.
All of the regiments of the corps were furnished with <span class="sans-serif">A</span>
tents, and the camp throughout was the most perfect in its
arrangements of any that we occupied during the war. The
quarters of the Thirty-sixth were regarded by the men with
especial pride.</p>

<p>Here the regiment remained for six weeks. During this
time much attention was given to regimental, brigade, and
division drills. About five hours each day were devoted to
these exercises, and they were of great value in perfecting
the discipline and adding to the efficiency of the regiment.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, February 18th, we learned that Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Goodell, of Company C, had been commissioned major of
the regiment, vice Barker, resigned. February 25th, General
Dix, who was in command at Fortress Monroe, reviewed the
Ninth Corps. The day was a beautiful one, and the review
a most brilliant and successful affair. Colonel Bowman and
Lieutenant-Colonel Norton both being absent, Major Goodell
commanded the regiment,&mdash;his first appearance in his new
rank.</p>

<p>On Sunday, March 1st, Chaplain Canfield preached on the
character of Washington. It was our first religious service
since New Year's. March 11th, with other regiments in our
brigade, we attended a flag presentation at the quarters of the
Eighth Michigan. Unexpectedly, on the evening of March
18th, we received orders to be in readiness to move with five
days' cooked rations.</p>

<p>Great had been our enjoyment of the sunny side of a
soldier's life which we experienced at this place; and it was
not without regret that we received the order to leave the
comfortable quarters on which so much time and labor had
been expended. Many pleasant circumstances had combined
to make this a most desirable encampment. In the first place,
we were in convenient communication with our friends at
home; some of them visited us, also the wives of several of
the officers, and the camp had quite a home-like appearance.
Then, too, we received, from time to time, many well-filled
boxes, and numerous other tokens of regard which friends at
home had prepared for us. A severe and protracted storm
delayed our departure, and some of these boxes which had
been anxiously awaited, and which we should have failed to
receive had it not been for the delay, made the closing days
of our camp-life at Newport News almost a continual feast.
The scenes that followed the arrival of these boxes were often
amusing as well as touching. For example: a day or two
before our departure several boxes were received by a squad
of about fifteen men from one town. At the opening of the
boxes all were present, and as their contents were distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
these sun-browned and apparently rough men, in the gladness
of their hearts, laughed, sung, and chatted like children.
Impromptu speeches were made, abounding in the most extravagant
praise of those who had joined in filling these
richly-laden boxes. In the midst of this hilarity one proposed
seriously that God should be acknowledged in this
reception of these generous gifts. In a moment all heads
were uncovered and bowed in reverent silence, while one of
the number gave thanks to the Giver of all good for favors
so kindly bestowed; and then, in tenderest words and
choked utterance, commended to His protection and care,
the loved ones at home who had been so thoughtful of them.</p>

<p>The storm having passed, we struck our tents on the afternoon
of March 22d, and marched to the landing at Newport
News. There seven of the companies embarked on the
steamer "Kennebec," the remaining three companies,&mdash;B,
C, K,&mdash;on the steamer "Mary Washington," with the
Forty-fifth Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

THE KENTUCKY CAMPAIGN.</h2>


<p>We left Newport News early the next morning, March 23d,
and sailed up the bay to Baltimore, where we arrived about
three o'clock on the morning of the 24th. The "Kennebec"
hauled in at Pier No. 1, but we did not land until afternoon.
Cars then were in waiting for us, and we learned that we
were to go west by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Cincinnati,
Ohio, being our destination. At Eutaw street soft
bread was issued to the men, and then, about six o'clock, we
started on our long journey. The freight-cars in which we
were packed were crowded with rough board seats, so that
there was no room in which to lie down; but the scenery
through which we passed was of the wildest and grandest
description, and the journey throughout was one of thrilling
interest to all. In the early part of it we passed through
Point of Rocks, Berlin, Sandy Hook, and Harper's Ferry,&mdash;all
familiar places. At Harper's Ferry, where we arrived
early in the morning of the 25th, we had bread and coffee.
For miles beyond the track had been torn up by the rebels
in the preceding year, and here and there the rails, twisted
by fire, lay in heaps by the roadside, unfit for further
use.</p>

<p>The country grew mountainous as we advanced. We
reached Cumberland about four o'clock in the afternoon.
At Piedmont, which we reached at six o'clock, we were most
cordially entertained by the Fourteenth Virginia regiment,
which was guarding the railroad at this point. The utmost
good feeling was manifested; and, as we left our Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
comrades, to resume our journey, all joined in three rousing
cheers. After a most fatiguing ride, with little rest or sleep,
we arrived at Parkersburg on the Ohio river, about five
o'clock in the afternoon of the following day, March 26th.
There we embarked on the steamer "Bostonia," a fine, commodious
boat. We left the landing about ten P.M. It was
a beautiful moonlight evening, and all greatly enjoyed the
change from the crowded cars. The next day was cool, but
pleasant, and we were delighted with the charming scenery
through which we passed as we rapidly glided down the river.
At almost every place on the Ohio side, and at some points
on the opposite shore, we were greeted with much enthusiasm.
The people flocked <i lang="fr">en masse</i> to the banks of the river, cheering
and waving flags, and bidding us God-speed in our efforts
to win victory and peace.</p>

<p>We reached Cincinnati about seven o'clock in the evening.
The regiment remained on the boat during the night, only
the officers being allowed to go ashore. Nor were the men
allowed to land the next day. That they were moved to
indignation by this restriction was a natural result. Other
regiments of the corps, which had preceded us, had been
most cordially received by the citizens, and most hospitably
entertained. The sons of Massachusetts resident in the
city were prepared to give the Thirty-sixth a no less hearty
welcome, and had provided a breakfast to which the regiment
was invited on the morning of the 28th. Expectation ran
high, and the regiment was putting on its finest airs in anticipation
of the reception, and especially at the prospect of
one good "square meal" after the long and tedious journey,
when, for some then unaccountable reason, the colonel
declined the invitation, and peremptorily refused to allow the
men to go ashore. When this became known the indignation
of the men was almost unbounded, and their disappointment
found expression in words of bitter complaint, more
especially as this refusal seemingly cast a reflection on the
good name and discipline of the regiment. In this feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of disappointment the citizens most heartily shared, many of
them visiting the boat, and expressing their regrets. It was
afterwards ascertained that, on account of the bad conduct of
some regiment that preceded us, General Burnside had issued
an order that no more regiments should stop in the city.
This relieved Colonel Bowman of the responsibility for the
disappointment of the men of his command; but the disappointment
was no less keenly felt.</p>

<p>March 28th we crossed the river to the Kentucky shore, and
landed at Covington. There was some delay in procuring
transportation; and, as there was a large amount of whiskey
near the station, some of the men became not a little demoralized.
One of this number had complained for some time
of severe lameness, and the surgeon, who had been puzzled
by his case, after watching him carefully, was about to secure
his discharge from the service. But, under the exhilaration
of the hour, forgetting his lameness, the man marched off so
smartly that Colonel Bowman informed him that the game
was up; and, providing him with a gun, ordered him back to
his company.</p>

<p>Leaving Covington at night, we found ourselves the next
morning, Sunday, March 29th, at Lexington, ninety-eight
miles from Covington. Here we encamped in a grove of
black walnut trees, adjoining the beautiful cemetery, in which
a magnificent monument has been erected over the remains
of Kentucky's illustrious son, the brilliant orator and statesman,
Henry Clay. The shaft is of gray limestone, one hundred
and thirty-two feet in height, and is surmounted by
Clay's statue. Ashland, the residence of Henry Clay, is
about a mile and a half distant.</p>

<p>Colonel Leasure, commanding the Third Brigade, was
assigned to the command of the post. In the days that followed,
the Thirty-sixth was engaged in doing provost duty
in the city, and in building a fort. The camp, although
very attractive, and kept scrupulously clean, did not prove
a healthy one. The cold April weather, and the naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
moist ground, as we were without fires in our tents, caused
much sickness from colds, chills, and intermittent fevers.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March a pleasant surprise was given to the
colonel, in the presentation of an elegant equipage for his
horse, by the sergeants of the regiment. The horse had
previously been presented to the colonel by the commissioned
officers.</p>

<p>Nothing of especial interest occurred until Sunday, April
5th. On that day a brigade service had been appointed, and
at three o'clock in the afternoon the Thirty-sixth and the
One Hundredth Pennsylvania assembled. In the midst of
the service, orders came for us to break camp immediately.
We struck our tents, and marched to the depot, where cars
were in waiting. Our baggage was put on board, and we
were off for Cincinnati at half-past five. We reached Covington
shortly after midnight, but remained in the cars until
morning. We then marched to an open field near the station,
and stacked arms. The colonel reported the arrival of the
regiment to General Burnside, and learned that it was election
day in Cincinnati, and we were there to quell any disturbance
that might arise at the polls. But no disturbance
occurred. We remained all day in the field near the depot,
suffering not a little from the cold, bleak wind. Tuesday
morning, about half-past seven o'clock, we left Covington,
and reached Lexington about half-past three in the afternoon,
when we marched to our old camp-ground, and spent the rest
of the day in rearranging our quarters. On the journey we
received a hearty greeting from the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
at Paris, where the regiment was stationed, and also from
the One Hundredth Pennsylvania, at Lexington, on our
return.</p>

<p>The next morning, April 8th, greatly to our surprise, we
received orders, about eight o'clock, to strike tents. All was
soon in readiness, and the brigade, the One Hundredth Pennsylvania
in advance, marched through Lexington. The
Thirty-sixth never made a better appearance than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
streets of Lexington that day. We reached Nicholasville
about five o'clock in the afternoon, and encamped just beyond
the town. The next morning we resumed our march, about
seven o'clock. The men became quite footsore as we advanced,
and many fell out. About one o'clock we crossed
the Kentucky river. The scenery was most attractive, high
rocky cliffs overhanging the river. We reached Camp Dick
Robinson, near Bryantsville, about four o'clock. The camp
had been occupied by the rebel General Bragg, who retreated
on the approach of the Union troops, having been informed
by a citizen that a large force was approaching.</p>

<p>April 13th, General Welch, formerly colonel of the Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania, but recently promoted, arrived at Camp
Dick Robinson, and assumed command of the First Division.
On the same day, Rev. C. M. Bowers, of Clinton, Mass.,
reached our camp, on a visit to the company from that town.
When he returned home, a few days after, many of the men
sent by him money which the paymaster had just left in their
hands, and most kindly and faithfully he attended to the
many little details of business thus confided to him.</p>

<p>The Forty-fifth Pennsylvania rejoined the brigade at this
place. April 20th, Colonel Norton, who had been home on
leave of absence, arrived in camp. The next day, April 21st,
Colonel Bowman received orders to select four hundred men
from his command, and to be ready to move the next morning
in light marching order. The battalion, commanded by Colonel
Bowman, left camp about six o'clock A.M., April 22d,
in a drenching rain, which continued until noon, when the sun
came out very warm, and made the march in the mud a
fatiguing one. But the change from the routine of camp-life
to a march through a wild and beautiful country was most
exhilarating. At about three o'clock in the afternoon the
battalion reached Harrodsburg, an aristocratic town, largely
in sympathy with the rebellion, and encamped for the night
on a beautiful green slope just outside of the town. In the
morning we marched through the town again, exciting much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
curiosity and some enthusiasm. From Harrodsburg the
march was continued ten or twelve miles, through a most
delightful country, to the beautiful town of Danville, where
we arrived about two o'clock in the afternoon, and halted for
dinner. A leisurely march of about eight miles brought us,
in the early evening, to our quarters at Camp Dick Robinson.
The purpose of this march has never been disclosed.
Colonel Bowman was not told. He was ordered to move;
the roads, the halting-places, etc., were designated, but concerning
the end in view he was not informed.</p>

<p>The regiment, with the brigade, remained at Camp Dick Robinson
until April 30th, when we were aroused at four o'clock
A.M., with orders to move at six. At the appointed time
we were on the march. It was a beautiful day, and the roads
were in excellent condition. We passed through Lancaster
about noon, and halted for dinner. Later in the afternoon
we encamped about a mile beyond Stanford. On the next
day, May 1st, we remained in camp until one o'clock P.M.,
when we continued our march, and encamped about a mile
beyond Hustonville. May 2d we advanced about ten miles
in the afternoon, and encamped at Middleburgh, which is situated
on a branch of the Green river.</p>

<p>On these marches amusing incidents were of frequent
occurrence. One day the Twenty-seventh Michigan, a new
regiment, had the advance; and, like all new troops, the men
marched too fast, and too long a distance without rest. The
next day the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania had the lead, and the
Twenty-seventh Michigan was sandwiched in between the
Forty-fifth and the Thirty-sixth. These two regiments had
an agreement in reference to the day's march. The Forty-fifth
started off with a long swing, and the Thirty-sixth followed
up "right smart," in rear of the Twenty-seventh.
The result was that the Twenty-seventh had a hard day of it.
Many of the men fell out on the march, and laid down by
the roadside, exhausted. Of course it was a good pull for the
old regiments. One man in the Thirty-sixth fell down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
fainted apparently. His eyes closed, and he seemed to be
in a bad way. However, his case was not considered a
serious one. The next morning the surgeon, who had some
suspicions that the man was "playing it," asked him some
amusing questions, and dismissed him without giving any
decision in his case. "What shall I mark him?" asked the
sergeant; "excused from duty, or not?" "Mark him for the
land of Canaan," said the surgeon.</p>

<p>May 3d, the day after we reached Middleburgh, two colored
boys came into camp, one of whom Captain Raymond hired,
and the other was hired by the non-commissioned staff. The
boys had just been arrayed in United States blue when the
master of Captain Raymond's boy made his appearance with a
cavalry officer, and, showing a writing, demanded his slave.
The boy was frightened at the sight of his master, and said
he would rather be shot where he was than go back to the
whipping that awaited him. But we had no authority to
detain him, and the master took him by the collar, and led
him off. After he had gone, the other boy, finding that we
could give him no protection, thought he had better go home
voluntarily. So he started. Such, at that time, was the
"peculiar institution" in Kentucky.</p>

<p>On the same day a Mr. Markham and three daughters&mdash;refugees
from East Tennessee&mdash;visited our camp. In
September, 1861, they were living in Scott County. One
day a party of rebels approached the house in search of the
father, who was a Union man. One of the rebels came forward
to reconnoitre, and asked one of the daughters where her
father was. She declined to answer. He then advanced
toward her with bayonet fixed. To defend herself she seized
an axe, and endeavored to parry his thrusts, but he succeeded
in forcing the bayonet into her skull, just above the eye,
putting out the eye, and causing the brain to protrude. The
father, hearing her cries, rushed from his hiding-place, and
shot the rebel dead. He then made his escape immediately.
One of the sisters ran to the house to warn her cousin to flee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
also; but, the rest of the rebels coming up, he was soon killed.
Two of their neighbors they hung, and left on the tree.
This was a new side of the war to us,&mdash;a side of which we
were to see more at a later period, when the regiment was in
East Tennessee.</p>

<p>May 4th we moved our camp forward about a mile, in order
to get upon better ground. On the following day our
regimental baggage was reduced. Only three tents were
allowed at head-quarters, while the line officers had five tents
instead of ten, as heretofore. Wednesday, May 6th, at dress-parade
a despatch from General Willcox to General Welch,
announcing cheering news from the Rappahannock, was read.
Not until two days later did we receive the tidings of Hooker's
defeat at Chancellorsville. On Sunday, May 10th, there were
rumors of the capture of Richmond. The first came early
in the afternoon. Not long after dress-parade Colonel
Bowman received a despatch, stating that Hooker,
reinforced, had recrossed the Rappahannock, and that
Stoneman and Dix had raised the stars and stripes on the
rebel capitol. The news was at once communicated to the
regiment, and was received with the wildest enthusiasm.
Fires were built on a high hill near the camp, candles were
issued to the men, and soon the camp of the Thirty-sixth was
all ablaze. Then the several companies, under command
of Captain Smith, with candles fixed on their bayonets,
marched to the camp of the Twenty-seventh Michigan and
One Hundredth Pennsylvania, cheering and receiving cheers
from both regiments, which were in line to receive us. When
the regiment returned to camp there were congratulatory
speeches by Colonel Bowman, Acting Adjutant Hodgkins,
Captain Warriner, Lieutenant Brigham, and others. It was
a fourth of July occasion. We soon learned that we had
exulted too soon.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, May 13th, rumors of a rebel raid by Morgan
reached us. The pickets were strengthened and thrown
farther out. Two days later a limited number of furloughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
were granted in each company, and the men under Captain
Raymond left for Stanford on their way home. There was
no further information concerning the rebel raid. The division
supply-trains moved back to Hustonville, also Edmunds'
Battery.</p>

<p>We remained at Middleburgh until Saturday, May 23d.
On that day, at noon, orders were received to move. The
Thirty-sixth led the brigade column. We encamped at night,
about nine miles beyond Liberty, on the banks of the
Green river. There we remained over Sunday. On Monday,
May 25th, the bugles called us out at half-past three in
the morning, and at five we were on the road. Our march
was through a thick forest during a greater part of the day.
About three o'clock in the afternoon we encamped a short
distance from Neatsville. On the following day, May 26th,
the <em>reveillé</em> was sounded at half-past two in the morning,
and we marched at half-past three. As on the
preceding day, our route lay through an almost unbroken
forest. At half-past nine o'clock in the forenoon we encamped
about a mile from Columbia.</p>

<p>May 27th we had orders to be in readiness to march at seven
P.M., in light marching order. At that time we left camp,
with the One Hundredth Pennsylvania and a section of
Edmunds' Battery, Colonel Leasure in command. Before
reaching Columbia a squadron of cavalry joined us. It was
understood that we were in pursuit of Morgan's guerillas.
Passing through the town, we took the Waynesburgh road;
but, after marching a mile or so, we faced about, returned to
town, and took the road to Glasgow. It was a beautiful
moonlight evening. The road was somewhat rough, and
mostly through woods. We reached Gradyville about one
o'clock on the morning of the 27th, and bivouacked for the
rest of the night. Later in the morning we marched to a
grove of magnificent beeches, on a hillside near by. There
we remained all day, while the cavalry scoured the neighborhood.
About noon they brought in two rebel officers. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
night it commenced to rain, but we made ourselves as comfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>The next day, Friday, May 29th, we marched about eight
o'clock, and found the road very rough as we advanced.
Notwithstanding the rain, we pushed on to Breedingsville,
fourteen miles from Columbia and sixteen from Burkesville,
on the Cumberland river. Weary and wet, we sought shelter
for the night in the out-buildings of a farm-house, while our
cavalry scouts set out for the river.</p>

<p>The next day, May 30th, the scouts having returned, we
turned our faces toward Columbia, which we reached between
eleven and twelve o'clock in the evening, having marched forty-seven
miles during our absence from camp, and captured
twenty-five prisoners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a serious accident had occurred at the camp. The
armorer was repairing some guns. One, which was not supposed
to be loaded, he put into the fire for some purpose,
and the gun was discharged. The ball entered the tent of
Quartermaster-Sergeant Joseph H. Sawyer, and struck one
of his knees. The wound was so severe that amputation was
deemed necessary, and the operation was skilfully performed
by Surgeon Prince.</p>

<p>Monday, June 1st, Colonel Bowman was assigned to the command
of the brigade, which now consisted of the Thirty-sixth
Massachusetts, Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, Seventeenth and
Twenty-seventh Michigan regiments. That night we received
orders to march, and at once proceeded to Jamestown, commonly
called "Jimtown," on the Cumberland river. It was
twenty miles from Columbia, and we reached the place about
four o'clock Tuesday morning. We had hardly stacked arms
on a wooded hillside near the town when a sharp skirmish fire
was heard on the road at our right, and presently a squad of
our cavalry dashed up the road toward the town, followed
closely by a company of rebel horsemen. Our men were
quickly in line of battle, under a ridge running parallel
with the road, and Companies A and F were thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
out as skirmishers. But the rebels, at the first sight
of our men, wheeled and made good their escape. They had
evidently intended to make a dash into the town, but the
timely arrival of our brigade was an unexpected episode in
the morning's adventure.</p>

<p>One of the rebels a citizen soon brought in as a prisoner.
It was found that he had been thrown by his horse, and
that the horse had escaped. The citizen met the rebel as he
was crossing a brook, after losing his horse, and kindly
offered to hold his gun&mdash;one of Colt's revolving rifles&mdash;until
he was over. The rebel innocently handed the gun
to the citizen, who at once informed him that he was his
prisoner, and marched him into our camp. Colonel Bowman
gave the citizen the rifle as a reward for his strategy. According
to the prisoner, his party consisted of three hundred
men. He was a conscript from East Tennessee, he said, and
belonged to Pegram's command.</p>

<p>Upon assuming command of the new brigade, which had
been formed in consequence of the reorganization of the
division, Colonel Bowman appointed First Lieutenant
Raymond as acting assistant inspector general, and
Second Lieutenant Hodgkins as acting assistant adjutant
general of the brigade. The last-named officer had performed
the duties of adjutant of the regiment during the
illness of Adjutant Ranlett, from January 19th, until his
appointment upon the brigade staff, when the latter resumed
his duties as adjutant.</p>

<p>We remained at Jamestown until Thursday, June 4th, when
at noon, to the surprise of all, we received orders to proceed
at once to Lebanon, which was sixty miles away, our nearest
railroad connection with the North. Although we had had
little or no rest for a week, in forty-eight consecutive hours,
including halts and sleep, we made the sixty miles, arriving
at Lebanon at noon, June 6th. And this long journey was accomplished
in heavy marching order, under a scorching sun,
and in dust which was almost insufferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>As his limb had not sufficiently healed, we were obliged to
leave Quartermaster-Sergeant Sawyer at Columbia. Private
James E. Spear, of Company B, remained with him, and both
eventually succeeded in reaching our lines in safety, having
been paroled by John Morgan, who, with his cavalry, drove
out our cavalry two days after we left.</p>

<p>At Lebanon we learned that our destination was Vicksburg,
Miss., Grant being in need of reinforcements. On the
afternoon of the following day, June 7th, we took the cars for
Louisville, where we arrived late at night, and the regiment
was paid off in the depot. The next day we crossed the
Ohio, by ferry, to Jacksonville, Ind. There cars were in
waiting, and we proceeded to Cairo, Ill., by way of Seymour,
Ind., and Sandoval, Ill. All the way we were received with
kindest attentions, in many instances ladies remaining all
night at the stations to serve us with refreshments, and
cheer us with loyal words. We reached Cairo on the 9th of
June.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

IN THE REAR OF VICKSBURG.</h2>


<p>Late in the afternoon of Wednesday, June 10th, the fine
steamer "Meteor," with the regiment (numbering about 760
officers and men), all its camp equipage, and horses, cast off
from the levee at Cairo, and steamed down the river. The
boat, though large, was somewhat crowded, and deeply laden.
A large part of the regiment was quartered on the hurricane
deck, which was the most comfortable part of the boat. The
officers had the use of the state-rooms and the cabin, and
had no reason to find fault with their accommodations.</p>

<p>Many of the regiment had provided themselves with little
maps of the river, and, with true Yankee curiosity, studied the
various points of interest with the skill and style of veteran
tourists. And truly these points were not rare, for this
region had already become famous in the war's history.
Before sunset the boat had passed the battle-field of Belmont,
Mo., the scene of General Grant's first battle of the war, and
Columbus, Kentucky. At the latter place the boat was
brought to by a shell across its bows, the captain, through
neglect or ignorance, failing in compliance with the rules of
the river to report to the commander of the place before
passing. A short distance below Columbus the boat was
moored to the shore for the night, it not being considered
safe, at this season of low water, to move a heavily laden boat
at night.</p>

<p>The following day passed somewhat slowly, the country
through which the Mississippi winds being low, monotonous,
and with few features of interest, Island No. 10 alone being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
worthy of note. Officers and men amused themselves in
various ways,&mdash;reading, writing, cards, etc. All military
duties being necessarily abandoned, it was a season of welcome
rest to all.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock P.M. the boat arrived at Memphis, Tenn.,
where it remained three days to await the remainder of the
corps, which was delayed up the river. This time passed
rather heavily. On two occasions the regiment landed, and
the boat was thoroughly policed, the change serving as a rest
for all. General Potter, with his staff, came aboard at
Memphis. At six P.M. of June 14th the boat cast off, and
steamed down the river until dark, and then lay to for the
night. All day of the 15th moving rapidly South we reached
Helena, Ark., where a brief landing was made for forage and
provisions. At night the boat stopped near White River;
and, being now in a thoroughly hostile region, a picket was
posted on shore, Captain Sawyer, of Company H, being in
command. Not long after dark, by some nervous sentry, an
alarm was given, which proved needless. "All quiet on
White River" was the watchword as the men lay down to rest
for the night.</p>

<p>The fleet, on leaving Memphis, consisted of five heavily
laden steamers, carrying the entire First Division of the corps,
with all its artillery, baggage, and animals. As the river, at
certain points, is narrow and densely wooded, affording excellent
positions for ambuscades of hostile parties, a guard was
mounted on the upper deck of each boat, with loaded rifles,
and orders to scan the shore carefully at such points. This
was called the "guerilla guard."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th, when the fleet got under way,
a river gun-boat joined us as escort, bringing up the rear
of the line. Its importance was soon felt by all. These
boats were iron-clad, having roofs slanting like the gable-roof
of a house, with port-holes, out of which grimly peeped the
muzzles of some 10-pounder Parrott guns. About eleven A.M.,
while in the neighborhood of Columbus, Ark., the "Meteor,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
being in the van of the fleet, suddenly received from the
western shore a sharp volley, the bullets striking the boat in
several places, fortunately doing no serious injury. The boat
following the "Meteor," at the same time, was also fired on,
and was less fortunate, one man of the Seventeenth Michigan
being wounded, and two horses killed. The gun-boat and the
"guerilla guards" immediately opened a heavy fire. The
enemy found the place rather hot, and soon their gray-clad
forms could be seen running "helter-skelter" from their
ambush. Whatever damage was done them we never knew;
but it is doubtful if they all escaped the Minies and bursting
shells which for a few minutes flew in volleys after them.
This incident tended to vary the monotony of life on board,
and the usual good fortune of the Thirty-sixth seemed to
attend it still. Late in the afternoon the fleet arrived at
Lake Providence, and remained over night. This place was
famous for the feat of engineering which, by means of a short
canal, had shortened the river very much, by diverting the
channel from one of its great bends. The First Kansas and
Sixteenth Wisconsin regiments were stationed here, and the
Massachusetts boys were soon fraternizing with the hardy
Western pioneers, armed in the same good cause.</p>

<p>June 17th the boat entered the Yazoo river, and, at eleven
A.M., arrived at Snyder's Bluff, where the regiment debarked,
and then marched about four miles, passing Haines' Bluff.
On every hand were fortifications crowned with cannon,
encampments of troops, army wagons, etc., etc.</p>

<p>This day, to a part of the regiment, was one of peculiar
import. Company B, of Charlestown, had in its ranks many
who were lineal descendants of the men who made the
17th of June glorious in our history; and to them the
booming of the cannon, heard from early in the day, was a
grim reminder of many a holiday at Bunker Hill, where, to
use a trite expression, "the day was ushered in with the
ringing of bells and firing of guns."</p>

<p>The first impressions of the men upon landing, far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
favorable, were never changed, except for the worse. In
many places the soil was so dry and parched with the heat
that it seemed to have cracked open like a blistered skin
beneath the tropical rays of the sun. The wind blew hot
from every point of the compass, bringing clouds of dust
along with it. Gnats and flies made night hideous, and drove
sleep from the weary. Venomous snakes and other reptiles
infested the woods and thickets. Lizards soon became no
novelty, and even the resort of keeping them out of one's
boots, by wearing them day and night, would not prevent
their crawling down one's back occasionally, causing a sensation
like an animated icicle.</p>

<p>But these were minor inconveniences. It is not pleasant to
have a thunder-squall burst almost from a clear sky and find
the guys of one's tent slacked up for air. Any old soldier
knows the result of such negligence. It means a sudden
breaking up of house-keeping, and a wet day to move.</p>

<p>During the 18th, 19th, and part of the 20th of June, the
regiment lay quietly in camp in a wood somewhere in the
township of Milldale, a very pleasant and picturesque
spot. The wild magnolia trees, now in full bloom, filled the
air with their fragrance. From many of the trees hung the
"Spanish moss," which was gathered in large quantities and
used for beds, and it proved an agreeable variation from the
hard, limestone beds of Kentucky. At three o'clock P.M.,
of June 20th, the regiment marched about three miles, and
went into camp at a cross-road, which proved to be its permanent
location during the rest of the siege of Vicksburg.
The One Hundred and Fourteenth Illinois Regiment, which
had been stationed here, gave way to the Thirty-sixth, and
went down into the trenches at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>This point was considered an important one, and the camp
of the regiment was arranged in a kind of semicircle, crossing
the road leading to Vicksburg, with a strong picket
thrown out for about a mile through the forest road which
led to the Big Black river. Rifle-pits were dug, and trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cut away to give sweep for a long distance to the artillery.
At this point Durrell's Battery of the First Division was
placed in position commanding the different approaches.
These precautions were rendered necessary by the presence of
a large rebel force, under General Joe Johnston, just across
the Big Black; and it appeared that to the Ninth Corps was
assigned the important duty of watching him and protecting
our men before Vicksburg from an attack in the rear.
Grant's army, therefore, presented the singular and rather precarious
military spectacle of facing in two directions, the one
portion attacking Pemberton, shut up with over thirty thousand
in Vicksburg, and the other facing Johnston, who, with
a force estimated at between thirty and forty thousand, was
manœuvring to break in and raise the siege. The latter
was liable to be heavily reinforced at any moment, and there
was no little anxiety in the mind of the commanding
general lest this should come to pass.</p>

<p>As the Thirty-sixth Regiment was not a part of the line
attacking Vicksburg, it is not perhaps necessary to say much
concerning the city and its defences.</p>

<p>The Mississippi river, about six miles above Vicksburg,
bends suddenly to the north-east, runs in this direction six
miles and then turns as suddenly to the south-west. By this
bend in the river a tongue of land reaches out from the
Louisiana shore, and near the end of this tongue, just below
the bend, on the left bank of the river, stands Vicksburg, on a
bluff of some two hundred feet or more in height. Being
also higher than any ground in its rear, it was a position of
unusual strength, completely controlling the river, though
Admiral Porter had succeeded, with considerable loss, in running
the batteries with a part of his fleet. Stretching away
from Vicksburg to the north-east is a range of hills, called
Walnut Hills, which terminate at Haines' Bluff, on the Yazoo
river. Here the rebels had erected heavy batteries commanding
the river, and had forced General Grant to approach
Vicksburg from the south. In the great battles at Champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Hill, Raymond and Baker's Creek, Grant had succeeded in
separating the forces of Pemberton and Johnston; and, following
up the former, had driven him into Vicksburg, at this
time getting possession of Haines' Bluff. This gave him a
good base for supplies, and direct communication by river
with the north. Before commencing a regular siege, it was
determined to try and carry Vicksburg by assault. It was
thought that the demoralized condition of Pemberton's army,
whipped from place to place, would render them hopeless of
success, and a long and tiresome siege be avoided. The commanding
general, officers, and men, were all of one mind in
this matter, and the soldiers were eager for the assault.</p>

<p>On the 22d of May an attempt was made along the entire
line to storm the city, but without success. The rebels, at
last driven to desperation, and protected by their ramparts,
fought well, and after heavy loss it was found impossible to
break through at any part of their lines.</p>

<p>Regular approaches were now commenced by sappers, and
General Grant, finding his ranks thinning by the severity of
the trench service, the increasing heat of summer, and Johnston,
with a large force, threatening his rear, called for reinforcements.
Such, briefly, was the condition of affairs, and
such were the reasons which found the Ninth Corps and the
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts in their present position.</p>

<p>The history of the regiment for the fortnight ending with
the fall of Vicksburg can be briefly written. It is a story of
discomforts, from causes before enumerated, against which the
men fortified themselves by all the means possible. Tents
were made comparatively comfortable by cane-pole shades
and beds of moss and grass. No duties were required except
picket and such as were absolutely necessary. Parties
were detailed from time to time to help dig rifle-pits, for
it was thought best to be well prepared for any sudden and
violent attack of Johnston. A large part of the line held
by the Ninth Corps was fortified in this way. But the work
was done as much as possible during the cooler parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
day, morning and night. There was not a dress-parade of
the regiment during the Mississippi campaign. Not much
can be said of the rations, though they were, perhaps, as good
as the men had been in the habit of receiving. On the 26th
of June Quartermaster Francis B. Rice was discharged, and
Lieutenant Cutter, of Company D, was appointed quartermaster.</p>

<p>June 29th the whole First Division, with the exception of
the Thirty-sixth Regiment and Durrell's Battery, moved out
several miles to the front, and the head-quarters of the brigade
were about five miles distant. Company F was at this time
on duty at corps head-quarters. Cases of sickness became
more numerous every day. Captains Bailey, Sawyer, and
Lieutenant Howe, were all sick at this time, the latter with
small-pox, which he was supposed to have contracted in
visiting a hospital at Memphis. He died July 7th. He was
a graduate of Amherst College, where he achieved distinction
in the department of mathematics. In character and conduct,
during his connection with the regiment, he showed
that he was a true man and a faithful soldier. When it
became known that this dire disease had broken out among
us there was much anxiety and alarm in the regiment, for the
possibility of its spreading was great, and there was no
way to meet it with usual precaution, the medical department
being poorly supplied. A hospital was established at
some distance from the regiment, and as soon as any man
showed symptoms of the disease he was removed to it. In
this way the spread of the disease was checked.</p>

<p>July 2d, burial service, with military honors, was performed
over the remains of Private Boswell, of Company C,
who died in the regimental hospital, July 1. Each day
seemed to have some event of more or less importance to
vary the monotony of camp life, which was now about to be
disturbed by events of great moment, and from the dull routine
of daily life to be changed to the more severe duties of
the march and battle-field. Even now, in the distant North,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the two great armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia,
under Meade and Lee, were grappling with each other on the
soil of Pennsylvania, and the fate of the nation was trembling
in the balance on the slopes of Cemetery Ridge, at Gettysburg.
Massachusetts was pouring out her blood freely on
that now historic field, while far away, in the south-west, her
sons stood ready to uphold her fame and carry her white
flag, side by side with the stars and stripes, to victory.
The moment pregnant with heroic effort and sacrifice was at
hand.</p>

<p>For a week prior to the 4th of July rumors of the impending
surrender or storming of Vicksburg prevailed in the
camp. The last extremity of famine was nearly reached by
the beleaguered rebels, who boasted from their ramparts of
the tenderness of mule steaks. No hope remained for them
save from without, and Lee was too closely occupied with
his movement into Pennsylvania to despatch any of his force
to Pemberton's relief. Johnston clung to the east bank of
the Big Black river. General McPherson's corps had pushed
the lines of investment up under the very forts of the enemy,
and there seemed to be nothing left but to carry their works
by assault, or wait for famine to do its work. The roar of
artillery was incessant. Day and night, with scarcely a
moment's interval, the heavy booming of the siege guns was
heard, and a thick cloud of smoke hung ever like a pall over
the doomed city. If a rebel showed so much as a hand
above the fortifications he became the target of our vigilant
riflemen, and the enemy found it impossible to man and serve
his artillery, so deadly was the fire. If morning revealed
some place where the rebels had repaired the ramparts and
brought some guns into position, ten minutes sufficed for our
artillery utterly to destroy the work of the night. Their
works were mined; but, wherever they suspected a mine,
resort was had to countermining, and for a time spades were
trumps at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>At three o'clock P.M., of July 3d, Generals Grant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Pemberton met under a flag of truce. Pemberton proposed
that his army be allowed to march out with the honors of
war, carrying their muskets and field-pieces, but leaving
their heavy artillery. Grant smiled at this proposal. The
interview terminated in an hour, with the understanding that
Grant should send in his <em>ultimatum</em> before ten o'clock that
night. This <em>ultimatum</em> was, that Pemberton should surrender
Vicksburg with all its property, his officers being allowed
to retain their side-arms, and the officers and men should be
paroled as prisoners of war. It was accepted, and, on the
morning of the 4th of July, General Logan's division of
McPherson's corps took possession of the works of Vicksburg,
the rebels marching out, stacked their arms, and laid
their colors on the stacks. The Forty-fifth Illinois Regiment
marched at the head of Logan's column, and placed its flag
upon the Court-House. The magnitude of this victory is
apparent from the fact that it comprised in its results 31,600
officers and men (2,153 of whom were officers, and 15 of
these generals), munitions of war sufficient for an army of
60,000, 172 cannon, many locomotives, cars, and steamboats,
and large quantities of cotton and other valuable merchandise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

THE MOVEMENT ON JACKSON.</h2>


<p>Hardly had the news of the surrender become known to
the regiment, however, before orders came to break camp
and prepare for field service in light marching order.</p>

<p>This was in accordance with an order which General Sherman
had received directing him to take his own corps, the
Fifteenth, the Ninth Corps, to which was temporarily assigned
General Smith's division of the Sixteenth Corps, and the Thirteenth
Corps, now under General Ord, pursue Johnston, and
capture or destroy his army. General Grant's order read as
follows: "I want you to drive Johnston out in your own way,
and inflict upon the enemy all the punishment you can. I
will support you to the last man that can be spared."</p>

<p>Before ten o'clock A. M., July 4th, Sherman's army was in
motion, and by various roads moving rapidly toward the Big
Black river. Johnston, finding himself suddenly an object of
particular interest, commenced a precipitate retreat toward
Jackson, feebly disputing our advance in some places where
the ground was favorable. Upon the receipt of marching
orders the picket of the Thirty-sixth was hastily called in,
and the regiment was soon on the march to overtake the
brigade, which it did not do, however, until the next day.</p>

<p>A considerable part of the 6th was occupied by the
regiment, and men of other regiments in the brigade, in constructing
a bridge across the Big Black river at a place
called Birdsongs Ferry. This was a good, strong piece of
work, and over it a large part of the army passed in safety.
General Ord's two divisions crossed at the railroad some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
distance below, and the Fifteenth Corps at Messenger's
Bridge.</p>

<p>From the 4th to the 10th of July the army pushed steadily
on, overcoming many obstacles, skirmishing sharply day and
night with Johnston's rear guard, and encountering sufferings
from the heat and exposure to sun and tempest and malarial
swamps, that are well-nigh indescribable. The rebels, as they
retreated, poisoned the wells, or killed animals in the ponds or
streams, their putrid carcasses rendering the water unfit for
use. Such acts only reacted upon themselves, for it
enraged the army from the commanding general down to the
private soldier, and they would have saved themselves the
pillage and devastation that marked our line of march, had
they adopted the rules of honorable warfare. But it seemed,
in their case, as if the old proverb was true, that "whom the
gods wish to destroy, they first make mad."</p>

<p>The rapid advance of the army made it impossible for the
supply-trains to keep up, and for days the rations consisted
of the unripe corn, roasted in the husks. All fared alike,
officers and men. The tents and all the baggage, save
blankets, had been left behind, and, during this campaign of
three weeks, the regiment slept with the sky for a canopy,
exposed to the deadly night-air and frequent tempests.
Nights when no humane man would drive a dog out of doors
found this entire army in the open field. Late in the afternoon
of July 7th, while on the march, a thunder-storm burst upon
us that no man of this regiment, then present, will ever forget,
and one that the natives call the severest known in that region
for years. The storm came apparently from all directions,
and lasted over two hours. The lightning struck all around,
and the roar of thunder was incessant. The horses became
terrified, and officers were forced to dismount and lead them.
The mud was ankle-deep, and finally impeded the movement
of the artillery, which stuck in the roads up to the hubs and
blocked the passage of the infantry. About 10 P.M. the
storm lulled, and the regiment went into bivouac in an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
field, and the men were ordered to make themselves comfortable.
Then came a second edition of the storm,&mdash;if possible,
worse than the first,&mdash;and there, shelterless in that open field,
the boys stood in grim despair and let it pelt. Finally, with
the stolid indifference of desperation the men laid down
in the mud of that old stubble-field and made themselves
comfortable. But all things come to an end, and so at last
did the storm, when the field was quickly ablaze with camp-fires,
and a dipper of hot coffee, innocent of milk or sugar,
revived the spirits of the men.</p>

<p>Jackson, the capital of Mississippi, is situated on the west
or right bank of the Pearl river, in a very fertile and pleasant
region. Being at the juncture of the Vicksburg and Meridian
and Mississippi Central Railroads, it is a position of great
strategical importance. The State House, which cost half a
million dollars, Executive Mansion, State Lunatic Asylum,
and Penitentiary are the principal buildings; but being the
seat of government, as well as a considerable commercial
mart, there are many fine residences in the town and its
suburbs. The site of the town itself is rather level, but back
of it the country is undulating and well adapted for defence.
It was expected that Johnston had been preparing for the
present emergency, and had fortified the place extensively.
The moral effect of the loss of the town would be great, and
the idea was quite prevalent that it would be desperately
defended. Indeed, as the army approached it, the more
stubborn resistance of Johnston's forces indicated that they
intended to dispute possession of their capital.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of July 10th the Ninth Corps came out into
open country in sight of the town. As the different regiments
and batteries debouched from the woods the colors were unfurled.
It was a beautiful sight, that "battle's magnificently
stern array." The sun was about an hour high, and its slanting
rays glanced brightly from the muskets and the brass field-pieces.
A gentle breeze stirred the silken folds of the standards,
and made them float proudly and defiantly. Conspicu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ous
among them could be seen the white flag of Massachusetts,
carried by the Twenty-ninth, Thirty-fifth, and Thirty-sixth
regiments. Sloping away in front was the valley along which
extends the track of the Mississippi Central Railroad.
Beyond, the ground rose gradually for about an eighth of a
mile, and the crest was crowned with a dense wood, in the
edge of which could be seen the rebel gray uniforms, and
the gleaming of bayonets. The lines were formed. The
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts held the extreme right of the
First Division, having on its left the remainder of the First
Brigade, the Seventeenth and Twenty-seventh Michigan, and
the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania deployed as skirmishers along
the entire brigade front. On the right was Smith's division
of the Sixteenth Corps, and connecting with the Thirty-sixth
Massachusetts was the Forty-sixth Ohio. What a
glorious sight! The old Bay State, with Ohio on her right,
and Michigan on her left, Pennsylvania leading, about to
close in conflict with Mississippi, and far away on the right
stretch the dark blue lines of Sherman's veterans, famous in
later times from "Atlanta to the Sea." And now there was
a pause, a silence that was ominous. Meanwhile, the intervals
were closed, and alignments rectified. Curiously we
peered into the distant wood, wondering whether it masked
the rebel artillery. Where could they find a better place to
use grape and canister? In the rear the splendid battery of
the First Division was preparing for action. Lieutenant
Benjamin's famous twenty-pounder rifled Parrotts, Battery E,
Second United States Artillery, whose iron throats had
carried dismay and death into the rebel ranks in other fields,
far away in Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina, were
about to speak. Breathlessly all awaited the puff and the
angry flash. It came, and over the valley, with a scream
and whir-r-r, was hurled the iron messenger of death. It
struck exactly on the crest of the hill, and exploded.
Scarcely had the reverberation ceased, when the order was
passed along the line: "Battalion forward! Guide centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
march!" With a simultaneous movement the lines
advanced, slowly at first, but more rapidly as they
approached the railroad. Behind us the Parrotts were
talking in thunder tones that shook the very earth, and the
shells were screaming overhead. The gallant Forty-fifth
crossed the railroad, and their thin line was soon seen pushing
up the hill. The Thirty-sixth followed in steady line of
battle. The suspense was awful. Why don't they open
fire? On the rebel side, save a few scattering Minies, that
sang harmlessly by, all was silent. Suddenly the men
became enthusiastic. With a "Hurrah," the men rushed up
the hill. The rebels fired a scattering volley, and fell back
upon their second line. The wood was gained, and with no
loss. A few moments sufficed to re-form the lines, which
again moved forward, passing the State Lunatic Asylum,&mdash;a
large, white marble building, whose inmates, wild with the
excitement of the unusual scene, raved at the regiment from
the iron-barred corridors. A guard was placed upon the
building, to protect the unfortunates. The lines moved cautiously
forward, until the skirmishers were checked, and the
rebel line developed. But the shades of night were now darkening
the landscape, and orders were received to establish a
strong picket, and hold the position until morning. Weary
with the march and exciting close of the day, all gladly improved
the opportunity for rest, laid down with loaded rifles
by their side, or gathered in groups, and discussed the events
of the day, or speculated upon the morrow. And some,
alas! laid down that night to happy sleep, who, ere another
came, were lying in a soldier's grave. Save occasional sharp
firing by the pickets, the night passed quietly.</p>

<p>At three o'clock A.M. of the 11th the men were noiselessly
aroused, and coffee, prepared by the company
cooks, was served out. With the earliest streak of dawn the
lines again moved forward, and the skirmishing opened
sharply. The rebels yielded ground stubbornly, but were
forced back into their main line of defence,&mdash;a formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
work constructed of cotton bales. Here they opened a heavy
fire of grape and canister, against which it was impossible to
advance. But not an inch was yielded. The brigade laid
flat on the ground, and the iron storm passed over, doing
little damage. The line was formed in a wood, in front of
which was an open field, the other side of which, about two
hundred yards distant, was held by the rebels, and their riflemen
were in trees, picking off our men, wherever exposed. The
skirmishers of the Forty-sixth Ohio suffered considerable
loss, being less sheltered by the wood than those of our
brigade. Nothing farther could be done until artillery could
be brought up; but the ground was unfavorable for it, and
matters came to a pause.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Benjamin reconnoitred the ground and the position
of the enemy, but could not find any position which
gave him room to work his guns. All day the regiment lay
under a constant and galling fire awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Companies A and F were sent out to skirmish, relieving
the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania. Captain Draper was ordered
to connect with the skirmishers of Smith's division, who
were said to be in position in a wood at our right, and
several hundred yards to the front. In our own front was
an open field, sloping toward the enemy's position. The
two companies promptly deployed, and went forward on the
double-quick, driving in the rebel pickets, only to find that
the line supposed to be General Smith's skirmishers was the
rebel main line. They opened fire, killing two and wounding
six of Company F, who, with Company A, returned the fire.
Seeing that some mistake had been made, and to prevent
needless sacrifice, Captain Draper ordered a retreat, halting
at a point midway between the enemy's line and our own,
where the ground afforded some protection. Here the two
companies held their position nearly all day until relieved.</p>

<p>The rebels during this time were unable to send out any
more pickets, owing to our fire; but several adventurous men
among them tried to observe our movements, and take an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
occasional shot by climbing trees inside their lines. Our boys
had the good fortune to bring two or three of them to the
ground during the day, Sergeant Daniel Wright, afterwards
lieutenant, making one of the successful shots. The loss in
Company F was two killed and six wounded. George H.
Ellis, of Milford, one of the killed, was shot through the
breast. This young man, the only son of a widowed
mother, was a favorite in his company and with all who
knew him. He had been acting as clerk at head-quarters
until just prior to the commencement of this movement,
and by his cheerful and gentlemanly conduct had won the
regard of all the officers there. His death was deplored by
all. Amos Hoyt was also killed, shot through the stomach.
O. Howard, James Smith, T. L. Ellsworth, J. C. Higgins,
D. Perham, and E. W. Anson, were wounded. Company
A, being less exposed, met with no loss, though it also
received a heavy fire from the rebel sharp-shooters.</p>

<p>This loss in Company F can only be considered as an
unnecessary one. No impression was made upon the enemy;
the main line was not advanced, for the First Division was
now close upon the enemy, and any advance would have
brought on a general engagement, which, it seems, General
Sherman did not desire. There was evidently some misunderstanding
between Generals Sherman and Parke, for the
latter had made all his disposition for an assault on the morning
of the 11th. This may have been caused by the check
met with by the Thirteenth Corps, on the right. One division
of this corps, General Lauman's, had been roughly handled,
and repulsed with a loss of over five hundred men and some
colors. The position of Johnston's forces was stronger than
had been expected, and his troops fought well. There was
much anxiety on the part of both Colonel Bowman, commanding
the brigade, and Lieutenant-Colonel Norton, commanding
the Thirty-sixth Regiment, when Companies A and
F were ordered out without supports, and only positive
orders prevented Colonel Norton from going out with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
regiment to the support of these companies when it was
learned what their position was. If a reconnaissance was the
object it was eminently successful; but otherwise the brave
advance of Company F can only be cited as a proof of the
good fighting qualities of the men, and a credit to their
discipline.</p>

<p>The skirmishers upon the right of the First Brigade were
not more than two rods in advance of the position held by
the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts, and it was with this line that
Companies A and F were to connect. There were some very
dangerous intervals between the different brigades, considering
the near proximity of the rebel force, and only good luck,
or the concealment afforded by the woods, prevented their
being observed and taken advantage of by the enemy.</p>

<p>Toward night a thunder-squall came up, and for over an
hour the battle raged with even greater fury, the booming of
man's artillery seeming to vie with Heaven's. It was a perfect
pandemonium of sound. The rain fell in torrents, the
lightning flashed, thunder pealed incessantly, and shot
and shell from the rebel guns fell and burst around. It
seemed as if "man fought on earth, and fiends in upper air."
At four P.M. Companies A and F were relieved by E and
K. The latter had hardly taken position when they were
handsomely charged upon by the rebel skirmishers, who
were as handsomely repulsed, Captain Warriner being in
command of the picket. That night the men lay on their
arms quietly, and on the morning of the 12th the brigade
was relieved by a brigade of the Second Division, and
marched to the rear, taking a position near the Lunatic
Asylum.</p>

<p>The movement now settled down into the nature of a siege.
General Sherman, being desirous of saving life, resolved upon
regular approaches by rifle-pits to force a surrender of the
city. During the 12th and 13th the regiment lay quietly in
the rear, resting and keeping as cool as possible in the shelter
of a piece of wood. Occasionally the rebels would throw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
thirty-two pound shot over into our neighborhood, creating
some excitement, but doing no harm.</p>

<p>On the 14th and 15th the regiment was again at the front,
and occupied the rifle-pits, Major Goodell being in command.
No loss was suffered during these two days, the men having
good shelter and having learned not to expose themselves
unnecessarily. The heaviest fighting seemed to be upon the
extreme right, the lines of investment having the Pearl river
on both flanks.</p>

<p>Some exciting incidents occurred, from time to time, to
vary the monotony. One day the men of the Second
Michigan lost their temper; and with the idea, perhaps, of
taking Jackson alone, made a gallant charge, breaking
through two lines of rebels, greatly to the astonishment of
the second line, whose arms were stacked and the men here
and there, not expecting callers. Not being supported, they
were compelled to fall back, which they did, very coolly,
bringing their killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Even a battle is not without its laughable side. One
day, while the regiment was in reserve, the men occupied
in various ways to kill time, suddenly shouting and
firing were heard on the right. The noise rapidly increased
and approached, and, its cause being doubtful, the men fell
in on the stacks. Presently there came dashing along a black
pig, one of the semi-wild species which wander about in this
region, and had rashly approached the lines, not being aware
that pork was a favorite dish. He met with a warm reception.
A sharp fusillade was opened upon him, and piggy fell, covered
with glory, having almost attained the honor of breaking
through the lines of the Fifteenth Corps. Ere the echo of
his dying squeal had fairly ceased he was broiling in steaks
over the camp-fires.</p>

<p>July 12th news was received of the fall of Port Hudson,
the battle of Gettysburg, and the defeat of Lee. The
cheering along the lines was deafening, and the drooping
spirits of all were roused by the glorious tidings. Early on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the morning of the 13th the rebels made a sudden and vigorous
sortie in front of Colonel Griffin's command. They were
repulsed with severe loss, and did not repeat the attempt.</p>

<p>On the 16th General Potter, with the Second Division and
Smith's division, made a reconnoissance. They advanced
until the enemy opened heavily with shell and canister, when
they fell back, having accomplished the desired end of discovering
the exact position and strength of the enemy. This
day General Sherman received a large supply of ammunition,
of which he had run very short, and it was determined to
bombard the works and assault them on the 17th; but during
the night the enemy's artillery and wagons could be distinctly
heard moving through the town, and, when morning dawned,
a white flag was seen on the rebel earthworks. General Ferrero's
brigade, in which was the Thirty-fifth Massachusetts,
entered Jackson, placed guards over the public property, and
sent out parties to pick up stragglers from the retreating
rebels. One thirty-two pounder was found in their works,
about one thousand stand of arms, and a large quantity of
munitions of war. One officer and one hundred and thirty-seven
men were captured. The railroad depot, and a few
buildings containing public property, were destroyed. The
flag of the Thirty-fifth Massachusetts waved from the dome
of the capitol of Mississippi.</p>

<p>General Johnston, in his "Narrative" (page 209), says his
army retreated east, to Brandon, where some soldiers, who
had been asleep when he evacuated Jackson rejoined him
late in the day, "and reported that at the time they left
Jackson, at seven or eight o'clock, the enemy had not discovered
his [Johnston's] retreat." This is incorrect. In the
report of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts, 1863, the
Thirty-fifth Massachusetts reports as follows: "<em>At about
daylight</em>, discovering that the enemy's works were evacuated,
moved forward," etc. The writer of these pages recorded, in
a diary written on the spot, the following: "<em>At daylight</em>
this morning the Second Division, being in front, heard loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
cheering, and learned that the rebels had evacuated Jackson."
In a letter written home at the time, I also find these words:
"<em>At six o'clock</em> this morning it was found that the enemy had
abandoned Jackson, and General Ferrero's brigade <em>at once</em>
entered the city." Certainly this should dispose of the charge
of lack of vigilance on our part. It seems that these men
did not report how they got across Pearl river, the bridges
of which were destroyed by Johnston's rear guard before
daylight, and if they were not aroused by their own comrades
movements it is not very strange that the retreat was
not discovered by our pickets. In this engagement Johnston
had about 28,000 by his own admission,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> though the
rebel Secretary of War reported his force at 34,000. Johnston
reported his army drawn from different commands, as
follows: From Pemberton, 9,831; Bragg, 7,939; Beauregard,
6,283; in all, 24,053. He also had a force of about
2,500 cavalry under General Jackson. These figures are no
doubt nearly correct. The lines around Jackson were defended
by these troops in four divisions,&mdash;the right, under
General Loring, extending from Pearl river to the Canton
road; General Walker's division, from the Canton road to
across the Clinton road; General French's division, from
the Clinton road to the New Orleans Railroad, and the left,
under General Breckenridge, extended from the railroad to
the river. That part of the line held by General Walker
was in front of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Johnston's "Narrative," page 195.</p></div>

<p>General Johnston reported his loss in the battle 71 killed,
504 wounded, and 25 missing. As we captured 138 prisoners,
there seems to be a wide discrepancy between their
<em>missing</em> and our <em>captures</em>. It is, therefore, quite probable
that the rebel losses were much greater than their general
admits in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The losses on our part, according to General Sherman's report,
were as follows: Thirteenth Corps, 762 killed wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and missing; Ninth Corps, 37 killed, 258 wounded, 33 missing;
Fifteenth Corps, a few; number not stated. General
Sherman also adds that he captured, in all, over 1,000
prisoners during the battle. These captures must have been
made by the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Corps. The latter,
Sherman's own corps, consisted of the First and Third Divisions,
under Generals Steele and Tuttle, and held the centre;
the Thirteenth Corps, as before remarked, being on the right.
Why this fine corps, the Fifteenth, was held back, and allowed
to take so little part in this battle, as is evident from their slight
loss, is among the mysteries of the war. The battle seemed
to be one of disjointed attacks, first in one place and then
another. It was the general opinion among the officers that
a simultaneous and vigorous assault of Johnston's lines on
the first day of the fight would have carried them. It is possible
that General Sherman feared to risk the consequences
of a repulse so far from any base or reinforcements. The
movement up to the attack upon Jackson was a bold one,
and boldly pushed. Much dissatisfaction was expressed
that an affair that might have been settled in a day should
have dragged along a week in this most trying season of the
year for such work. General Johnston felt well satisfied
to be able to draw off his army safely from what might have
been made a second Vicksburg.</p>

<p>It was hoped that the capture of Jackson would be the
close of the campaign, the impolicy of pursuing a demoralized
enemy further at this season being apparent to all. But
there was hard work yet to do. Scarcely was it known that
the city was in possession of our forces ere marching
orders were received, and together with the other regiments
of the First Division the Thirty-sixth marched about
eight miles north, to a place called Grant's Mills, where we
bivouacked for the night. Early on Saturday, the 18th, we
marched five miles and struck the Mississippi Central Railroad.
During this day and until ten A.M. of the 19th the
regiment was engaged in destroying this railroad. Tough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
work it would have been, even in the coolest weather and
under the most favorable circumstances; but under a burning
July sun, with no shelter, the work was terribly exhausting.
The method of proceeding was to tear up the rails and
lay them crosswise with alternate rows of sleepers. When a
pile was built as high as the rails could be lifted, a fire was
kindled beneath, and the rails, red-hot, were warped and
ruined by the weight of the mass of rails and sleepers above.
Another way was to heat the middle of a rail red hot and
twist it around a tree. In this way about ten miles of this
railroad were destroyed by the division in two days, rendering
a main line of transportation useless and seriously crippling
the rebel communications.</p>

<p>At noon of the 19th, after setting fire to a depot which
burned like a tinder-box, we commenced the return march to
Jackson. The fatigues and sufferings of this march were partially
forgotten in the glad tidings which there awaited us,
that the Ninth Corps was under orders to proceed North at
once.</p>

<p>At three A.M., July 20th, the regiment was on the
march, and with the exception of a halt from eleven A.M.
to three P.M. marched till dark, in all a distance of eighteen
miles.</p>

<p>In recalling this day and the one following no man of
the Thirty-sixth can fail to be overcome with the memories
to which it will give rise. The regiment was a mere
wreck. When it halted for the night, on the 20th, one
man of Company E dropped down and died of exhaustion,
and while on the march one of Company H died from the
same cause in an ambulance. When the regiment halted at
noon of the 21st it did not stack one hundred guns, and, for
no apparent reason whatever, on these two days, the regiment
marched a distance of thirty-two miles. The heat and dust
were overpowering, and officers forgot all discipline and
straggled with the rest. The ambulance and teams were
crowded with exhausted men. At nine P.M. of the 21st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the regiment halted about a mile from the Big Black river,
bivouacking in a cornfield; a delightful place in some
respects, because lying between the hills one could not easily
roll out of bed, and the savory diet on which the regiment
had regaled for about three weeks could be picked in all its
luxuriance from the bed-posts. The single objection to cornstalks
two or three inches in diameter for bedding is that
they have a depressing influence upon the bones of the hips
and back.</p>

<p>July 22d the regiment did not move until noon, and then
only four miles, crossing the Big Black river, and camped in
a shady wood, with plenty of water at hand. It appeared to
have dawned upon some one in command of this division or
corps that there is a limit to man's endurance. July 23d
<em>reveillé</em> was sounded at two A.M. and, marching at four, we
pushed on rapidly, the day being unusually comfortable, and
at eleven o'clock A.M., after a march of fourteen miles, arrived
at the old camp at Milldale.</p>

<p>The condition of the regiment at this time was miserable
indeed. Sixteen cases of small-pox and varioloid, three
being officers, were under treatment, and the regimental hospital
was filled with sick. The adjutant's morning report of
July 24th was as follows: 6 officers and 98 men present
sick, and 63 men absent in hospitals, 25 officers and 343
men present for duty.</p>

<p>It was a season of general depression among all, and the
only thing to relieve the gloom was the prospect of a speedy
departure for the North,&mdash;an event most anxiously awaited and
desired. To add to the general discouragement, a number of
officers of the regiment who had resigned received their
discharge. Colonel Bowman, Lieutenant-Colonel Norton,
and Lieutenants Tucker and Holbrook left for the North
August 2d, making six officers lost to the regiment since its
arrival in Mississippi. Major Goodell took command of the
regiment July 30th. The resignation of Colonel Bowman
left the brigade in command of Colonel David Morrison, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the Seventy-ninth New York "Highlanders," and the brigade
was now composed of the Seventy-ninth New York, Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania, Eighth and Seventeenth Michigan, and
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts,&mdash;the entire brigade numbering
hardly five hundred men fit for service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

THE RETURN TO KENTUCKY.</h2>


<p>The days between our arrival at Milldale and the departure
for the North were devoted to rest and recruiting
the shattered strength of the men. Never was rest so welcome,
never so necessary, as now. Various diseases prevailed.
Mumps and chills and fever spread rapidly, and it is safe to
say that there was not an officer or man in the regiment who
could call himself well and hearty. Whiskey, doctored with
quinine, was served out at this time as a protection against
chills. Although it was of the genuine "lightning" brand
"commissary" it probably did little good, the mischief being
already done, and the "ounce of prevention" came too late.</p>

<p>August 2d all the sick who could be moved were sent off
to a hospital boat, and Surgeon Prince went in charge of
them. On this day also the following Special Order was
received from General Grant:&mdash;</p>

<p>In returning the Ninth Corps to its former command, it is with
pleasure that the general commanding acknowledges its valuable
services in the campaign just closed. Arriving at Vicksburg
opportunely, taking position to hold at bay Johnston's army, then
threatening the forces investing the city, it was ready and eager to
assume the aggressive at any moment. After the fall of Vicksburg
it formed a part of the army which drove Johnston from his position
near the Big Black river into his entrenchments at Jackson, and,
after a siege of eight days, compelled him to fly in disorder from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the Mississippi valley. The endurance, valor, and general good
conduct of the Ninth Corps are admired by all, and its valuable
coöperation in achieving the final triumph of the campaign is
gratefully acknowledged by the Army of the Tennessee. Major-General
Parke will cause the different regiments and batteries of
his command to inscribe upon their banners and guidons "Vicksburg
and Jackson."</p>

<p>At eight o'clock A.M., August 4th, orders were received
to break camp and proceed to the landing. Never was an
order obeyed with more joy and alacrity than this. The
regiment was quickly on the march, and, though the day was
hot and the road dusty, the march of seven miles was cheerfully
borne, for we could not be sufficiently thankful to get
away from Mississippi. Upon arriving near the landing, it
was found that the boats had not arrived, but were taking in
fuel at Vicksburg, and another night must be spent here. A
worse, more uncomfortable night the regiment did not experience
in Mississippi. As if to improve their last opportunity,
swarms of gnats, of the most savage description,
attacked the regiment, and few will ever forget that sleepless
night. It was indeed a fitting close of the campaign.</p>

<p>The boat arrived in the night, and the forenoon of the 5th
was employed in loading her with the baggage, horses, and
guns, of Battery E, Second United States. At three o'clock
P.M. the regiment marched aboard the fine steamer
"Hiawatha," in company with the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
Twenty-seventh Michigan, and the regulars of Battery E,
which crowded the boat most uncomfortably, though her
accommodations were large. About four P.M. the boat cast
off, and, steaming down the Yazoo, entered the Mississippi at
sunset, and as her course was directed northward a worn
but happy band of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts laid down
to rest, thankful, after all their trials, to have been spared
through that short but fatal campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>All night of the 5th the boat moved slowly North, being
very heavily laden, and her crowded condition made it very
tedious for all. Late in the afternoon of the 6th the boat
passed Columbus, Ark., noteworthy as the place where the
regiment received a "guerilla" salute, on its way down the
river.</p>

<p>August 7th, all day we were moving slowly up river,
and at sunset we stopped about twenty minutes at Helena,
Ark., for provisions.</p>

<p>We arrived at Memphis on the forenoon of the 8th, and
the men were landed on an island a short distance above the
city, where they remained while the boat was thoroughly
cleansed, and at five P.M., we reëmbarked, and were off
again. August 9th was Sunday, and in the forenoon divine
services were held by the chaplain of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania.
Private M. H. Fay, of Company G, died this day on
board, and at night the boat stopped at New Madrid, Mo.,
while his body was buried ashore.</p>

<p>Monday, August 10th, at nine o'clock A.M., two months
to a day from the time the regiment left Cairo, it arrived
there and landed, glad enough to step once again on Northern
soil. Late in the afternoon the regiment was transferred
to cars of the Illinois Central Railroad, rode all night, all the
next day, and late in the evening reached Vincennes. All
along the road the troops were received with great enthusiasm.
The well-known old Ninth Corps, fresh from its new
triumphs, received the cordial greeting of a grateful people.
This was most gratifying to the soldiers, and partially repaid
them for their sufferings. Flowers were literally showered
by fair ladies upon the bronzed veterans, collations were
provided wherever the cars stopped, and the course of the
regiment through Illinois was one continuous ovation.</p>

<p>At noon, August 12th, the regiment arrived at Cincinnati,
and after a bountiful collation at the Fifth-street Market, provided
by generous citizens, we crossed the river to Covington,
Ky., and went into quarters in some barracks. The baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
was delayed, and many of the officers slept this night on as
soft a board as they could find, with no covering, and did not
suffer with the heat.</p>

<p>Major Goodell, having left for home "on leave" for twenty
days, the regiment was now under command of Captain
Barker, of Company A. For four days the regiment lay in
camp at Covington, and had its first dress-parade for a period
of three months. The adjutant's walk from the right to the
centre was a very short one.</p>

<p>Every day the effect of the southern campaign was shown
in the increasing number of the sick. Many were sent to
hospitals, and the regiment rapidly decreased. Chills and
fever were most prevalent, and a disease similar to scurvy
broke out, and caused the death of several, whose flesh
actually fell from their limbs before death relieved them from
their sufferings. All complained of a feeling of exhaustion,
and officers and men dragged themselves painfully and slowly
about the camp.</p>

<p>Of the officers who had been left behind on account of
sickness two died. Second Lieutenant Frederick H. Sibley,
of Company A, died in hospital at Louisville, Ky., August
17th. He had been commissioned First Lieutenant, but
died before receiving his commission. Captain Christopher
S. Hastings, of Company I, died September 8th, in hospital
at Mound City, Ill. Both were true, faithful men, and their
loss was deeply lamented.</p>

<p>August 17th the regiment took cars, and, after riding all
night, arrived at Nicholasville at daylight. Marching out
about three miles from the town, we encamped in a fine shady
grove, with plenty of water at hand. Here we remained ten
days, and enjoyed a most welcome rest.</p>

<p>The paymaster arrived, and paid off the regiment, August
19th, and more than $3,000 of their pay was sent to Worcester,
by the men, for their families. Dr. Bryant, the only
surgeon present, being sick, the surgeon of the Seventy-ninth
New York was detailed to attend the sick of the Thirty-sixth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The regimental musicians, from the ravages of small-pox
and other diseases, were now all gone, and for a time it
became necessary to obtain the services of musicians of the
Forty-fifth Pennsylvania to sound the calls for the Thirty-sixth.</p>

<p>August 27th <em>reveillé</em> sounded at three A.M., and at half-past
five the regiment was on the march, a large number
being left behind, too weak to march. We passed through
Bryantsville at half-past nine o'clock A.M., and when the
regiment halted for a rest, at ten o'clock, it stacked ninety-eight
muskets.</p>

<p>One year ago this day the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts
was mustered into the United States service, 1,040 strong.
At eleven o'clock we went into camp, at Camp Dick Robinson
where the regiment was encamped in the spring.</p>

<p>August 28th we were early on the march, and a very hard
one it was for what was left of the regiment, and that was not
much. We marched eleven miles, passing through Lancaster
with colors flying, and the regiment stacked sixty-eight guns,
when it halted at noon four miles beyond Lancaster.</p>

<p>This bare fact seems to render needless all further comment
as to the condition of the regiment. It was no longer a
regiment, but a worn and weary band, a squad of each company
struggling on, fighting bravely against fatigue, and heat,
and illness. But what was now left may well be called the
very heart and soul of the Thirty-sixth,&mdash;men who had never
flinched; who had borne all, thus far, cheerfully and bravely,
with indomitable spirit. Very many were gone; but enough
still remained to guard the colors, to escort them on many
a long and weary march, and carry them in the front of many
a battle yet to come.</p>

<p>August 29th the march was continued about six miles, to
Crab Orchard, where the regiment encamped in the edge of a
wood, and remained until September 10th. This brief
period was occupied in various camp duties, and preparations
for an active campaign, for the corps was under marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
orders for Tennessee, and this halt was only to allow the
remainder of the corps to come up. Each day there were drills
and dress-parade, and men who had been left behind were
constantly rejoining the regiment until it began again to
present quite a respectable front.</p>

<p>Saturday, September 5th, the regiment was inspected
by Captain Simcoe, Division Inspector General, and the
report thereon was briefly: "Equipments much worn, and
clothing poor, but muskets in fine order." With the cooler
weather of autumn, better rations, and rest from fatiguing
marches, the men rapidly improved in health and spirits.
Crab Orchard is quite a favorite resort of the people of
Kentucky, and is celebrated for its mineral springs, and as a
very healthy region. Whether the men tried the waters of
the springs or not the writer cannot say; they certainly were
not delectable to the taste, and it is very doubtful whether
they were used medicinally. Twenty very happy men left
here for home, on a furlough for twenty days, greatly envied
by their comrades.</p>

<p>It was long ere any of these rejoined the regiment, and
some never returned. Lieutenant-Colonel Goodell, having
exchanged the golden leaves of Major, for the well-earned
silver leaves, rejoined the regiment, August 31st, and was
heartily welcomed, as was also Major Draper, upon whom
the golden leaves had deservedly fallen, and who returned
September 9th, with Dr. J. H. Prince.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

IN EAST TENNESSEE.</h2>


<p>At an early hour in the morning of September 10th, the
familiar call of "assembly" sounded once more. Camp was
quickly broken, and at eight o'clock the regiment was on the
march for Tennessee. Having the head of the column we
did not find the march a severe one, though the roads were
rough; and at five o'clock P.M., after a tramp of eleven
miles, we halted for the night at Mount Vernon. More
than one hundred and fifty of the regiment were left at Crab
Orchard on the sick list, too feeble to march, but most of
them rapidly gaining strength; and if the regiment could
have remained there a week longer many of them would
have been in the ranks again, for active service.</p>

<p>September 11th <em>reveillé</em> was sounded at half-past three
o'clock A.M., and we marched at five. The sun was hot and
the roads rough; country mountainous, and thinly settled. We
marched fifteen miles, and at night bivouacked on the bank
of Little Rockcastle river. A courier from General Burnside
brought stirring news from the front, of the capture of
Cumberland Gap, and its garrison of over two thousand
rebels.</p>

<p>September 12th the regiment marched eight miles, and
went into camp at noon. A severe thunder-shower came up
at night; the baggage being far behind, and the field and
staff without any tents, Lieutenant Tuttle, in charge of the
division ambulance corps, kindly provided a tent for the use
of the head-quarters.</p>

<p>September 13th, Sunday, we lay quietly in camp,&mdash;a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
welcome rest,&mdash;for the men were getting very footsore from
the rough Kentucky roads. It would be hard to find worse
ones even in rocky New England.</p>

<p>September 14th we were on the march at five A.M., and
moving rapidly until after one P.M., a distance of fourteen
miles. Between eleven and twelve o'clock the regiment halted
by the roadside and witnessed the passage under guard of
the rebel prisoners captured at Cumberland Gap. They numbered
about twenty-two hundred, and consisted of the Sixty-second
and Sixty-fourth North Carolina, Fifty-ninth Georgia,
and a Virginia regiment of infantry and some artillery. It
was generally conceded that they were a very forlorn-looking
set, and would fare much better as prisoners than as fire-eaters.
General Frazer, their commander, was with them,
riding in an ambulance. It appeared that they had been led
to believe that the Ninth Corps had surrounded them, and
they were much disgusted to find they had surrendered to
the Twenty-third Corps, which was composed of new troops.</p>

<p>Between sunrise and noon of the 15th we marched fourteen
miles, and encamped at Barboursville, on the Cumberland
river. Before marching this morning, a detail of three
officers (Captain Holmes, Lieutenants Hodgkins and Davis),
and six men left us, for the purpose of returning to Massachusetts,
and bringing out the conscripts assigned to the
Thirty-sixth Regiment, according to orders received at Nicholasville.</p>

<p>September 16th the regular order for some days had been
<em>reveillé</em> at half-past three and move at five A.M., and this
day was no exception to the rule. The march was slow and
quite easy,&mdash;only ten miles. The regiment was in camp
by ten o'clock A.M., and had a good long day to rest.</p>

<p>There is very little level ground in Eastern Kentucky, and
the luck of the regiment seemed to be to camp on side-hills,
where some care had to be exercised to avoid rolling off. To
prevent sliding down hill endwise, a log or rail was laid at
the foot of the tent and secured. This proved a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
foot-board. We remained at this place until the 19th, and
the paymaster arrived. No person was more welcome in
camp, or received such general attention. The adjutant gave
checks, on the city banks of Worcester, for the large sum of
$3,917.50. This fact is very creditable, and a good index of
the solid, frugal character of the men, who, though their
wants were numerous and our popular sutler was present
with a good stock, did not forget the little family of loved
ones at home; but in many cases, to the writer's knowledge,
sent home their hard-earned pay to the last dollar.</p>

<p>September 18th it rained in torrents all day, and seemed
very much like the equinoctial storm. The order to march
at six this morning was countermanded, though the regiment
was up at half-past four o'clock, and all ready.</p>

<p>September 19th, on the march at six A.M. The roads
were badly washed by the storm, or rather the places where
the roads were; for they could be called little better than
cow-paths. We crossed the Cumberland river at Cumberland
ford, and encamped at noon. The weather began to
be cold and raw as we approached the high region of the
Cumberland mountains.</p>

<p>Sunday, September 20th, as usual we were in line at
six A.M., and marched until noon, much of the distance up
hill, a rather toilsome march of nine miles. Passed through
Cumberland Gap at half-past eleven A.M., and encamped in
Tennessee at noon. The march was relieved of much of its
tediousness by the grandeur of the scenery. As the regiment
moved from one height to another of the ranges of hills
the scene in every direction was magnificent; and when, at
length, the Gap was reached, there was an universal expression
of admiration. Standing in the Gap is a large, square,
white stone, of the native limestone, which marks the corner
boundaries of three States, and at this point the view is
grand; the ranges of hills and the valleys of Tennessee
stretching away as far as the eye could reach, the great Smoky
range of North Carolina bounding the southern horizon. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
seemed incredible to all that this place, a perfect Gibraltar,
should have been surrendered as it was. Fortified extensively
with bomb-proofs, having only a narrow, winding approach
on either side, it seemed as if a few resolute men
could hold it against an army. And so they could; but,
alas for the South, Frazer was no Leonidas!</p>

<p>Between five A.M. and five P.M. of the 21st, with a rest
of two hours at noon, the regiment marched nineteen miles,
and camped near the Clinch river. We passed through
Tazewell, a considerable town, but showing signs of its recent
occupation by the rebel and Union troops alternately. The
absence of the top rails in this region was especially remarked,
now that the season for evening camp-fires had
arrived.</p>

<p>A long march of twenty-two miles was made on the 22d
(a mile for every day of the month), and during the day the
Clinch and Holston rivers were forded. This was a very interesting
sight, especially to those who had got safely over
and looked back to see some luckless wader lose his footing
and take an involuntary bath, which, the water being shallow,
was attended with no great peril. The bare-legged "Highlanders"
seemed to enjoy the temporary necessity for their
native costume. The line of march this day was through
the most attractive part of East Tennessee. No State in the
Union can boast of more beautiful scenery, and the regiment
must have been inspired by it; for though one of the longest
day's marches on its record, up hill and down and across
broad rivers, there was no straggling, and the entire command
stacked arms at sunset at Morristown, Tennessee, on
the line of the Virginia and East Tennessee Railroad.</p>

<p>On the 23d and 24th the regiment made an unnecessary
march of twenty miles, owing to the blunder of a telegraph
operator, and at ten A.M. of the 24th reëntered Morristown,
where it was found that the division had gone to
Knoxville, and the Thirty-sixth was ordered to remain and
garrison the town in company with the Twelfth Michigan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Battery, which it did until the afternoon of the 26th, when it
was relieved by the Twelfth Kentucky.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock P.M. the regiment embarked in the cars,
and, riding all night, arrived at Knoxville, marched a half
mile, and encamped in a wood in the suburbs, where we remained
until October 3d. Captain Smith, of Company K,
rejoined the regiment here on the 28th of September, and
was warmly received. Rumors prevailed of a severe battle at
or near Chattanooga, and the defeat of Rosecrans; and it was
also reported that a large force of rebels was concentrating
at Greenville for an attack upon Burnside. The few days
of rest here were enjoyed by all, and the men improved them
in repairing their wardrobes and preparations for more hard
work.</p>

<p>Before daylight, October 3d, orders were received to march
at eight A.M., in "light marching order, with five days'
rations and forty rounds of ammunition per man," the destination
being "a point beyond Greenville." As this "point"
was known to be the rebel force, the affair savored strongly
of a fight. As the regiment passed through Knoxville on its
way to the cars, with drums beating and colors flying, it
passed the head-quarters of General Burnside, and gave him
a marching salute.</p>

<p>We had a long day in the cars, going slowly, as the road
was a pretty rickety affair in many places, and about sunset
we arrived at Bull's Gap, sixty miles from Knoxville, where
a small force was found, consisting of the One Hundred and
Third Ohio Infantry and Second East Tennessee Regiment.
Large numbers of men were constantly coming in from the
east, many of them refugees, and some rebel deserters.
The former were mostly anxious to enlist in the Union ranks,
and seemed bitterly in earnest in their desire to drive the rebels
from here. Their sufferings and privations since the war
broke out had been terrible,&mdash;their homes destroyed, families
scattered or forced to hide in caves in the hills. It is no
wonder they welcomed the Union army as their saviors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
liberators. Old men and women stood by the roadside and
audibly thanked God and blessed the soldiers as they marched
past. Little Union flags, made of the roughest material, but
with the true colors, that had long been hidden sacredly away,
were waved triumphantly, and were greeted with cheers by
the Yankee boys, who no less proudly displayed the beloved
silken standard that they had followed so long, and which,
like them, was beginning to have a war-worn, veteran look.</p>

<p>A march of four miles, October 4th, brought the regiment to
a place called "Lick Creek," where it remained until the 10th,
awaiting the arrival of other troops and the Commanding
General. The Eighth Tennessee Infantry, and the Ninth
Michigan and Seventh Ohio Cavalry were already here, the
enemy being in force at Blue Springs, about three miles from
this place, closely watched by the cavalry pickets. Probably
all who went into camp with the Thirty-sixth this day recall
the amusing incident of the grand rabbit-hunt when the regiment
broke ranks. The field seemed to be alive with the little
animals, and the men, never averse to variety in their bill-of-fare,
turned into Nimrods like magic. The bewildered rabbits,
headed off in every direction, rushed upon their fate, and
game suppers were "<i lang="fr">à la mode</i>."</p>

<p>The Second Brigade of the First Division, and four large
regiments and three batteries of new troops under General
Willcox, arrived on the 8th, and on this day the cavalry
captured a rebel foraging train of thirteen wagons and nine
drivers. From them it was learned that a large force, under
Generals Breckenridge, Jones, Crittenden, Courcy, and
Ransom, was at Blue Springs, in a strong position, and meant
fight. The regiment was now small in numbers, but tough
and healthy, and certain to give a good account of itself
whatever service it might be called on to perform.</p>

<p>The nature of the country about Blue Springs was such
that it was easy to conceal a large force of troops, and
difficult to reconnoitre. Strips of dense woodland, alternating
with open and some hilly country, gave good oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>tunity
for planting and masking artillery, and it was necessary
to approach the rebel position cautiously, it being
difficult to develop. Early on the morning of October 10th
the entire force was on the march, Burnside being present in
command, and as usual, when he showed himself to his boys,
he was warmly and vociferously greeted. The regiment
moved slowly until, at about noon, it appeared to be checked,
and heavy firing of artillery showed that the engagement was
opened. Until about 3 P.M. the fighting was left to the
Twenty-third Corps, which, however, seemed to make little
or no impression upon the enemy, and was meeting with
considerable loss. Up to this hour the First Brigade, of
which the Thirty-sixth was a part, was in reserve, within
easy rifle-shot of the rebel line, awaiting orders. Not far
from the left of the brigade a section of Osborn's New York
battery was engaged in shelling a piece of wood at a distance
of about one hundred and fifty yards in front, where the rebel
soldiers were posted, and had all day very obstinately resisted
the efforts of the artillery and Twenty-third Corps to dislodge
them. Generals Burnside, Willcox, Ferrero, and other officers
were near this section, watching the effect of the firing.
About half-past three o'clock P.M., General Burnside ordered
General Ferrero to advance with his division and clear out this
wood at the point of the bayonet. The First Brigade was at
once in motion, the Seventy-ninth New York on the right,
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts in the centre, and Eighth Michigan
on the left; the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, as usual, was
deployed as skirmishers. After moving a short distance by
the right flank to get the shelter of a wood, the right of the
brigade struck the rebel line, and received a heavy fire, from
which the Seventy-ninth New York sustained some loss.
The brigade then "changed front forward," which brought the
Thirty-sixth and Eighth Michigan out into an open field,
when the enemy opened a sharp fire of musketry from behind
a fence that bordered the strip of wood. But no sooner did
the brigade front their position than it dashed forward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in less time than it takes to tell it drove back the rebel
force, killing some and capturing fifteen men of a Georgia
regiment. Their entire line broke, fled through the woods
over a hill, and took shelter behind their artillery, which now
opened fire at short range.</p>

<p>The brigade followed the retreating enemy until ordered
to halt by General Ferrero and await further orders, having
done all it was expected to do in a very short space of time.
The halting of a charging line of infantry under a heavy fire
is a delicate manœuvre. The men, excited by the charge, can
more easily be led forward than held steadily in the position
taken. At such a moment the example of the officers is
indispensable, and it was while in front of the colors, calling
upon the regiment to keep the line "steady," that Lieutenant-Colonel
Goodell fell, severely wounded by a piece of shell in
the thigh. He was carried to the rear, and the command
devolved upon Major Draper. There was much sorrow at
the loss of the young and favorite colonel, and a desire was
expressed to get at the battery that threw the shell.</p>

<p>The regiment lay quietly and coolly under the fire of the
rebel guns until dark, and, being sheltered by the slight rise
of ground along its front, did not suffer much loss. Lieutenants
Holmes and Robinson were wounded, the latter in the
head, and three men of Companies A, D, and H; only one
severely,&mdash;Woodward, of Company H. Considering the
severe fire to which the regiment was exposed for more than an
hour, its escape from great loss was noteworthy. General
Burnside sent an aid down to congratulate the brigade upon
the manner in which it carried the wood and unmasked the
rebel batteries.</p>

<p>It was thought that the rebels, being so strongly posted
and in large force, would hold their ground. During the
night earthworks were thrown up along the ridge held by
the brigade, and before daylight two guns of Roemer's battery
were brought up and trained. With the earliest morn
the Eighth Michigan skirmished forward, and found that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
rebels had retreated, evidently in haste. The pursuit was at
once commenced and pushed rapidly; the regiment marched
nineteen miles, and a little after dark halted at a place called
Rheatown, eight miles beyond Greenville. All along the
route were seen the evidences of the hasty retreat of the
enemy, who abandoned their wounded and much baggage.
Their rear was harassed by our cavalry, who killed and
captured many.</p>

<p>All day, October 12th, orders were expected to continue
the pursuit, and the regiment lay in line. But the cavalry
reported the enemy so scattered and broken up that General
Burnside concluded not to follow them further with infantry,
and the corps was ordered back to Knoxville. The next day
the regiment marched sixteen miles, passing through Greenville
again,&mdash;a considerable town, which is noteworthy as the
home of Andrew Johnson, and the place where he is now
buried.</p>

<p>October 14th, the Seventy-ninth New York, Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania, and Companies H and F of the Thirty-sixth,
took cars for Knoxville at noon. The rest of the regiment,
with the Eighth Michigan, marched to Bull's Gap to take the
cars,&mdash;a march of fourteen miles,&mdash;and arrived at Knoxville
late in the night. There was a general idea now prevalent that
the corps would go into winter-quarters here; but, after a
rest of five days, the regiment marched to Loudon, about
thirty miles south-west of Knoxville, on the south bank of
the Little Tennessee river, an attack by the enemy from this
quarter being threatened.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

THE RETREAT FROM LENOIR'S AND THE BATTLE OF CAMPBELL'S
STATION.</h2>


<p>From October 22d to October 28th the Thirty-sixth
Massachusetts was encamped at Loudon, but the enemy
failed to appear. At half-past two o'clock, on the morning
of the 28th, the baggage was sent across the river,
the regiment followed, and the pontoons were taken up.
The regiment then marched to Lenoir's, about twenty-three
miles south-west of Knoxville, and halted for the
night. On the following day orders were received to establish
a permanent camp for the winter. Never was such an
order more welcome. A year of varied and arduous toil
was to be followed, it was supposed, by a season of grateful
rest.</p>

<p>The place selected for the winter-quarters of the regiment
was a thrifty young oak grove, nearly a quarter of a mile
east of the little village of Lenoir's. The camp was laid out
with unusual care. In order to secure uniformity throughout
the regiment, the size of the log-houses&mdash;they were to
be ten feet by six&mdash;was announced in orders from regimental
head-quarters. The work of construction was at
once commenced. Unfortunately we were so far from our
base of supplies&mdash;Camp Nelson, Kentucky&mdash;that nearly
all our transportation was required by the Commissary Department
for the conveyance of its stores. Consequently
the Quartermaster's Department was poorly supplied, and
the only axes that could be obtained were those the pioneers
and company cooks had brought with them for their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
use. These, accordingly, were pressed into the service, and
their merry ringing, as the men cheerfully engaged in the
work, could be heard from early morning until evening.
Small oaks, four and five inches in diameter, were chiefly
used in building these houses. The logs were laid one
above another, to the height of four feet, intersecting at the
corners of the houses like the rails of a Virginia fence. The
interstices were filled with mud. Shelter tents, buttoned
together to the size required, formed the roof, and afforded
ample protection from the weather, except in very heavy
rains. Each house had its fireplace, table, and bunk.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November the houses were nearly completed
throughout the camp; and as we sat by our cheerful
fires that evening, and looked forward to the leisure and rest
of the winter before us, we considered ourselves the happiest
of soldiers. Unless something unforeseen should happen,
we thought we were sure of a quiet and pleasant winter at
Lenoir's.</p>

<p>That something unforeseen, however, was at hand, and
our pleasant dreams were destined to fade away like an unsubstantial
pageant, leaving not a rack behind. At four
o'clock, on the morning of the 14th, the sergeant-major hurried
to the officers' quarters with the order, "Be ready to
march at daybreak." The order was at once repeated to the
orderly sergeants of the several companies. Forthwith the
camp was astir. Lights flashed here and there through the
trees. "Pack up! pack up!" passed from lip to lip. "Shall
we take everything?" was the eager inquiry on every hand.
"Yes, everything," was the reply from head-quarters. Reluctantly
the shelter-tents were stripped from the well-built
houses, which were justly the pride of both officers and men.
Knapsacks and trunks were packed. The wagon for the
officers' baggage came, was hurriedly loaded, and driven
away. A hasty breakfast followed; then, forming our line,
we stacked arms, and awaited further orders.</p>

<p>The meaning of all this is not so dark now as it was then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Lieutenant-General Longstreet, who was in command of the
best corps in Bragg's army at Chattanooga, received instructions,
November 3d, at a counsel of war, to move his command
against Burnside. Bragg's formal letter of instructions
was dated November 4th, and on that day Longstreet
put his troops in motion, with orders "to drive Burnside out
of East Tennessee first; or, better, to capture or destroy
him." He had with him more than fifteen thousand men,
besides Wheeler's cavalry,&mdash;"portions of five brigades"
(perhaps five thousand more),&mdash;and eighty pieces of
artillery. General Grant, who at that time was mustering
his forces for an assault on Bragg, at once was informed of
the movement. As early as October 26th he had thought of
the possibility of such a movement, and had telegraphed to
Burnside, "Do you hear of any of Bragg's army threatening
you from the south-west?" He now, November 5th,
announced to Burnside the departure of Longstreet, saying,
"I will endeavor, from here, to bring the enemy back from
your right flank, as soon as possible." Accordingly, two
days later, he ordered Thomas to attack Bragg. "The
news is of such a nature," he said, in his order, "that it becomes
an imperative duty for your force to draw the attention
of the enemy from Burnside to your own front." But
Thomas had no horses with which to move his artillery, and
the attack was necessarily delayed. November 12th Burnside
telegraphed to Grant: "We will endeavor to hold in
check any force that comes against us, until Thomas is
ready."</p>

<p>This force, under Longstreet, was close upon us. The
next day, November 13th, Burnside ascertained that Longstreet
had reached the Tennessee river at Hough's Ferry, a
few miles below Loudon. He at once informed Grant, and
proposed to concentrate his forces and fall back on Knoxville,
so as to draw Longstreet as far from Bragg as possible.
And this was the reason why we were so suddenly called to
leave our comfortable winter-quarters at Lenoir's. Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>street
had thrown a pontoon across the river, and was moving
across his entire command, except the cavalry under
Wheeler, which he had sent by way of Marysville, with
orders to seize the heights on the south bank of the Holston
river, opposite Knoxville. Knoxville was Longstreet's objective.
It was the key of East Tennessee. Should it fall
into the enemy's hands we should be obliged to retire to
Cumberland Gap. Lenoir's did not lie in Longstreet's path.
If we remained there he would push his columns past our
right, and get between us and Knoxville. It was evident,
therefore, that the place must be abandoned, and there was
need of haste. The mills and factories in the village
were accordingly destroyed, and the wagon-train started
north.</p>

<p>The morning had opened heavily with clouds, and as the
day advanced the rain came down in torrents. A little before
noon our division, then under the command of General
Ferrero, moved out of the woods, but, instead of taking the
road to Knoxville, as we had anticipated, the column marched
down the Loudon road. Grant had telegraphed Burnside:
"If you can hold Longstreet in check until Sherman gets up,
or, by skirmishing and falling back, can avoid serious loss
to yourself, and gain time, I will be able to force the enemy
back from here, and place a force between Longstreet and
Bragg that must inevitably make the former take to the
mountain passes by every available road, to get to his supplies."
We, then, were to watch the enemy, and so not
only secure the safety of our trains and material, then on
the way to Knoxville, but also to have a part in the great
work Grant had undertaken in the campaign upon which he
had just entered.</p>

<p>A few miles from Lenoir's, while we were halting for rest
in a drenching rain, General Burnside passed us on his way
to the front; under his slouched hat there was a sterner face
than there was wont to be. "There is trouble ahead," said
the men; but the cheers which rose from regiment after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
regiment, as with his staff and battle-flag he swept past us,
told the confidence which we all felt in Old "Burnie."</p>

<p>One incident of that march is still fresh in memory. Captain
Buffum's mess had secured several goodly turkeys,
which were still fattening for the approaching Thanksgiving.
They were entrusted that morning to Jim, the captain's
colored servant, with many injunctions to faithfulness. Late
in the afternoon Jim was discovered empty-handed. "Where
are those turkeys?" thundered the captain. "I don't know,
sah," replied Jim; "I was tired, and lef' 'em by the road."
"O Jim," added the captain, "I knew you would yet ruin me!"</p>

<p>Chapin's brigade of White's command (Twenty-third Army
Corps), was in the advance; and, about four o'clock, his
skirmishers met those of the enemy, and drove them back a
mile and a half. The country became hilly as we advanced,
and our artillery moved with difficulty. At dark we were in
front of the enemy's position, having marched nearly fourteen
miles. Our line was formed in a heavy timber, and we
there stacked arms, awaiting orders. It still rained hard;
but here and there, we hardly know how, fires were made,
to prepare the ever-welcome cup of coffee; and then, weary
and wet, we laid down on the well-soaked ground.</p>

<p>During the evening a circular was received, notifying us
of an intended attack on the enemy's lines, at nine o'clock
P.M., by the troops of White's command; but, with the exception
of an occasional shot, the night was a quiet one.
The rain ceased about ten.</p>

<p>Two additional despatches had been sent by Grant that
day. The first asked, "Can you hold the line from Knoxville
to Clinton for seven days?" And again, at ten o'clock,
he added, "It is of the most vital importance that East Tennessee
should be held. Take immediate steps to that end."</p>

<p>The next morning, at daybreak, our line was noiselessly
formed, and we marched out of the woods into the road.
But it was not an advance as we anticipated. During the
night Burnside had issued orders for his troops to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Lenoir's. Such was the state of the roads, however, on
account of the heavy rainfall of the day before, that it was
almost impossible to move our artillery. At one time our
whole regiment was detailed to assist Roemer's battery.
Near Loudon we passed the Second Division of our corps,
which, during the night, had moved down from Lenoir's, in
order to be within supporting distance. But the enemy did
not seem to be disposed to press us. We reached Lenoir's
about noon. Sigfried, with the Second Division, followed
later in the day. Our brigade (Morrison's) was now drawn
up in line of battle on the Kingston road, to check any movement
the enemy might make in that direction. A small
force appeared in our front about three o'clock, and drove
in the pickets. The Eighth Michigan was at once deployed
as skirmishers. The Thirty-sixth Massachusetts and Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania at the same time moved forward to support
the skirmishers, and took a position in the woods, on
the left of the road. Just at dark, to feel our position, the
enemy made a dash, and pressed our skirmishers back nearly
to our line, but declined to advance any further.</p>

<p>Burnside now made preparations to withdraw from Lenoir's,
and fall back on Knoxville. About the station nearly
one hundred wagons were drawn up, and as the mules were
needed in order to move the artillery, the spokes of the
wheels were cut, and the stores and baggage in the wagons
were destroyed. At the same time a portion of the Ninth
Corps, under Colonel Hartranft, and a body of mounted
infantry, were sent toward Knoxville, with orders to hold the
junction of the road from Lenoir's with the Knoxville and
Kingston roads, near the village of Campbell's Station. The
distance was only eight miles; but the progress of the
columns was much retarded. Such was still the condition
of the roads that the artillery could be moved only with the
greatest difficulty. Colonel Biddle dismounted some of his
men and hitched their horses to the guns. In order to
lighten the caissons, some of the ammunition was removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
from the boxes and destroyed; but as little as possible, for
who could say it would not be needed on the morrow?
Throughout the long night officers and men faltered not in
their efforts to help forward the batteries. In the light of
subsequent events, as it will be seen, they could not have
performed any more important service. Colonel Hartranft
that night displayed the same spirit and energy which he
infused into his gallant Pennsylvanians at Fort Steadman in
the last agonies of the rebellion, when, rolling back the
fiercest assaults of the enemy, he gained the first real success
in the trenches at Petersburg, and won for himself the double
star of a major-general.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Thirty-sixth and the other regiments of
Morrison's brigade remained on the Kingston road in front
of Lenoir's. The enemy, anticipating an evacuation of the
place, made an attack on our lines about ten o'clock P.M.;
but a few shots from our pickets were sufficient to satisfy
him that we still held the ground. Additional pickets, however,
were sent out to extend the line held by the Eighth
Michigan. The Thirty-sixth Massachusetts and Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania still remained in line of battle in the woods.
Neither officers nor men slept that night. It was bitter cold,
and the usual fires were denied us, lest they should betray
our weakness to the enemy. The men were ordered to put
their canteens and tin cups in their haversacks, and remain
quietly in their places, ready for any movement at a moment's
notice. It was a long, tedious, anxious night; what
would the morrow bring? It was Sunday night. The day
had brought us no rest, only weariness and care. No
one could speak to his fellow; and in the thick darkness,
through the long, long night, we lay on our arms, waiting
for the morning. How many hearts there were among
us which, overleaping the boundaries of States, found their
way to Pennsylvania and New England homes; how many
which, on the morrow, among the hills of East Tennessee,
were to pour out their life's blood even unto death!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the morning came. It was cloudy as the day
before. White's division of the Twenty-third Corps was
now on the road to Knoxville; and, besides our own brigade,
only Humphrey's brigade of our division remained at Lenoir's.
About daybreak, as silently as possible, we withdrew
from our position on the Kingston road, and, falling
back through the village of Lenoir's took the Knoxville road,
Humphrey's brigade, consisting of the Second, Seventeenth,
and Twentieth Michigan regiments, covering the retreat.
The enemy, Hood's division, at once discovered this movement,
but, lingering around the burning baggage and stores,
did not press us till we were within about two miles of
Campbell's Station. Humphrey, however, held them in
check with the loss of a few killed and wounded,&mdash;among
the former Colonel Smith, of the Twentieth Michigan,&mdash;and
Morrison moved rapidly on to the point where the road from
Lenoir's unites with the road from Kingston to Knoxville.
It was evidently Longstreet's purpose to cut off our retreat
at this place. For this reason he had not pressed us at
Lenoir's, the afternoon previous, but had moved the main
body of the force under his command to our right. But the
mounted infantry, which had been sent to this point during
the night, and which had moved out on this road, were able
to hold his advance in check till Hartranft came up.</p>

<p>On reaching the junction of the roads Morrison ordered
us into an open field on our left, and the Thirty-sixth was
directed to take position in rear of a rail-fence, with our
right resting on the Kingston road. The Eighth Michigan
was on our left. The Forty-fifth Pennsylvania was deployed
as skirmishers. Meanwhile the rest of the troops on the
road from Lenoir's, and those which had preceded us, were
moving to a position selected by Burnside, a little way beyond
the village of Campbell's Station; and we were left to cover
the movement. Unfurling our colors we awaited the advance
of the enemy. There was little delay. In our front there
was an occasional shot, and also to our right; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
soon evident that the enemy were moving to our left, in order
to gain the cover of the woods and obtain a more favorable
position for attack. Moving off by the left flank, therefore,
we took a second position in an adjoining field. Finding
now the enemy moving rapidly through the woods, and
threatening our rear with increasing numbers,&mdash;Hood's division,
that had followed us from Lenoir's, being now up,&mdash;we
executed a left half-wheel, and, advancing on the double-quick
to the rail-fence which ran along the edge of the
woods, we opened a heavy fire. The manner in which Major
Draper handled the regiment in these trying circumstances
was worthy of the highest praise. From this new position
the enemy at once endeavored to force us. His fire was
well directed, but the fence afforded us a slight protection.
Lieutenant J. B. Fairbank and a few of the men were here
wounded. For a while we held the enemy in check, but at
length the skirmishers of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, who
were watching our right, discovered a body of rebel infantry
pushing toward our rear from the Kingston road. Colonel
Morrison, our brigade commander, at once ordered the
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts and Eighth Michigan to face
about, and establish a new line in rear of the rail-fence on
the opposite side of the field. We advanced on the double-quick,
and, reaching the fence, our men, with a shout,
poured a volley into the rebel line of battle, which not only
checked its advance, but drove it back in confusion.
Meanwhile the enemy in our rear moved up to the edge of
the woods, which we had just left, and now opened a brisk
fire. We at once crossed the fence, in order to place it
between us and his fire, and were about to devote our attention
again to him when orders came for us to withdraw, it
being no longer necessary for us to hold the junction of the
roads, as all our troops and wagons had now passed. The enemy,
too, was closing in upon us, and his fire was the hottest.
We moved off in good order; but our loss in killed and wounded
was quite heavy, considering the time we were under fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the killed was Lieutenant P. Marion Holmes (Co.
B), of Charlestown, Massachusetts, of whom it might well
be said,</p>

<p class="center">"He died as fathers wish their sons to die."
</p>

<p>Lieutenant Holmes had been wounded in the foot at the
battle of Blue Springs, October 10th, and, as the wound was
not fully healed, had made the march from Lenoir's that
morning with great difficulty. But he would not leave his
men. On his breast he wore the badge of the Bunker Hill
Club, on which was engraved the familiar line from Horace,
which Warren quoted just before the battle of Bunker Hill:
"<i lang="la">Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</i>,"&mdash;It is sweet and glorious
to die for one's country. In the death of Lieutenant
Holmes the regiment sustained a great loss. Frank, courteous,
manly, brave, he had won all hearts; and his sudden
removal from our companionship, at that moment, will ever
remind us of the great price with which that morning's success
was bought. His men made a noble endeavor to bear
the body from the field; but the enemy were pressing us so
hard that they were reluctantly compelled to leave it near
the spot where the lieutenant fell. There he was buried,
and his grave marked, so that, a few weeks after, friends
from home found the spot, and took up the remains, and
brought them to Charlestown, Mass., where funeral services
were held January 18, 1864.</p>

<p>As we left the open field, and entered the woods between
us and Campbell's Station, the enemy manœuvred to cut us
off from the road, so that we were obliged to oblique to the
left. Moving on the double-quick, receiving an occasional
volley, and barely escaping capture, we at length emerged
from the woods on the outskirts of the village. Our formation
by fours was well preserved in this movement, and
Major Draper afterwards learned from a rebel officer, that
the order and steadiness displayed by the Thirty-sixth under
these trying circumstances, prevented an attack upon us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
which might have led to a serious disaster to our brigade.
He said they thought there was a "Regular" regiment among
the rest, upon which the others might form.</p>

<p>Passing through the village of Campbell's Station, we were
soon under cover of our artillery, which General Potter,
under the direction of General Burnside, had placed in position
on high ground, just beyond the village. Campbell's
Station is situated between two low ranges of hills, which are
nearly a mile apart. Across the intervening space our infantry
was drawn up in a single line of battle. Ferrero's
division of the Ninth Corps held the right; White's division
of the Twenty-third Corps held the centre; and Hartranft's
division of the Ninth Corps held the left. Benjamin's, Buckley's,
Getting's, and Von Schlein's batteries were on the
right of the road. Roemer's battery was on the left. The
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts supported Roemer.</p>

<p>Longstreet, meanwhile, had disposed his forces for an
attack on our position, but was delayed on account of the
difficulty experienced in moving his artillery. At noon the
rebels came out of the woods just beyond the village, in two
lines of battle, with a line of skirmishers in front. The
whole field was open to our view. Benjamin and Roemer
opened fire at once; and so accurate was their range that
the rebel lines were immediately broken, and they fell back
into the woods in confusion. The enemy, under cover of the
woods on the slope of the ridge, now advanced against our
right. Christ's brigade, of our division, at once changed
front. Buckley executed the same movement with his battery,
and, by a well-directed fire, checked the enemy's
progress in that direction. The enemy next manœuvred to
turn our left. Falling back, however, to a stronger position
in our rear, selected by General Burnside, we established a
new line about four o'clock in the afternoon. This was done
under a heavy fire from the enemy's batteries. Ferrero was
now on the right of the road. Morrison's brigade was
placed in rear of a rail fence, at the foot of the ridge on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
which Benjamin's battery had been planted. Several of the
Thirty-sixth were wounded by the packing of the shells fired
by Benjamin; and by a piece of a shell from the same battery,
that burst prematurely, Sergeant Gallup, of Company A,
was so severely wounded that he died in a short time. The
position for the regiment was a very trying one. The
enemy, however, did not seem inclined to attack us in front,
but pushed along the ridge, on our left, aiming to strike
Hartranft in flank and rear. He was discovered in this attempt;
and, just as he was moving over ground recently
cleared, Roemer, changing front at the same time with Hartranft,
opened his three-inch guns on the rebel line, and drove
it back in disorder, followed by the skirmishers. Longstreet,
foiled in all these attempts to force us from our position,
now withdrew beyond the range of our guns, and made
no further demonstrations that day. Our troops were justly
proud of their success; for, with a force not exceeding five
thousand men, they had held in check, for an entire day,
three times their own number, and with a comparatively
small loss.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the Ninth Corps there were twenty-six
killed, one hundred and sixty-six wounded, and fifty-seven
missing. Of these the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts had one
officer and three enlisted men killed, three officers and fourteen
enlisted men wounded, and three enlisted men missing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> General Longstreet, in his official report of this action, says: "As soon as McLaws
got up he was ordered to deploy three of his brigades in front of the enemy,
and to put the other brigade upon a ridge on our left, so as to threaten the enemy's
right. At the same time, Colonel Alexander put his artillery in position, and General
Jenkins was ordered with Hood's division around the enemy's left, and, upon arriving
opposite the enemy's position, to make an attack upon their flank, while General McLaws
was advancing against the enemy's front to follow General Jenkins' attack. The
flank movement and the fire of our batteries caused the enemy to retire in some haste.
McLaws' division advanced promptly, and brought the enemy to a stand about a mile
further toward his rear, in a more commanding position. If General Jenkins could
have made his attack during this movement, or if he could have made it after the enemy
had taken his second position, we must have destroyed this force, recovered East
Tennessee, and in all probability captured the greater portion of the enemy's forces.
He attributes his failure to do so to some mismanagement of General Law. Before I
could get a staff officer to him to ascertain the occasion of the delay, night came on
and our efforts ceased."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>At six o'clock P.M. Ferrero's division, followed by Hartranft's,
moved to the rear, taking the road to Knoxville.
White's division of the Twenty-third Corps covered the retreat.
Campbell's Station is a little more than sixteen miles
from Knoxville; but the night was so dark, and the road so
muddy, that our progress was much retarded, and we did not
reach Knoxville till about four o'clock the next morning.
We had now been without sleep forty-eight hours. Moreover,
since the previous morning, we had marched twenty-four
miles and fought a battle. Halting just outside the town,
weary and worn, we threw ourselves on the ground, and
snatched a couple hours of sleep. Captain O. M. Poe,
Burnside's engineer, had been sent from Campbell's Station
to select the lines of defence at Knoxville. This, from his
familiarity with the ground, he was enabled readily to do;
and early in the day&mdash;it was the 17th of November&mdash;General
Burnside assigned the batteries and regiments of his
command to the positions they were to occupy in the defence
of the place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

THE SIEGE OF KNOXVILLE.</h2>


<p>Knoxville is situated on the northern bank of the Holston
river. For the most part the town is built on a table-land,
which is nearly a mile square, and about one hundred
and fifty feet above the river. On the north-east the town
is bounded by a small creek. Beyond this creek is an elevation
known as Temperance Hill. Still further to the east
is Mayberry's Hill. On the north-west this table-land
descends to a broad valley; on the south-west the town is
bounded by a second creek. Beyond this is College Hill;
and still further to the south-west is a high ridge, running
nearly parallel with the road which enters Knoxville at this
point. Benjamin's and Buckley's batteries occupied the unfinished
bastion-work on the ridge just mentioned. This work
was afterwards known as Fort Sanders. Roemer's battery
was placed in position on College Hill. These batteries were
supported by Ferrero's division of the Ninth Corps, his line
extending from the Holston river on the left to the point
where the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad crosses the
creek mentioned above as second creek. Hartranft connected
with Ferrero's right, supporting Getting's and the
Fifteenth Indiana batteries. His lines extended as far as first
creek. The divisions of White and Hascall, of the Twenty-third
Corps, occupied the ground between this point and the
Holston river, on the north-east side of the town, with their
artillery in position on Temperance and Mayberry's hills.</p>

<p>Knoxville at this time was by no means in a defensible
condition. The bastion-work, occupied by Benjamin's and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Buckley's batteries, was not only unfinished, but was little
more than begun. It required two hundred negroes four
hours to clear places for the guns. There was also a fort in
process of construction on Temperance Hill. Nothing more
had been done. But the work was now carried forward in
earnest. As fast as the troops were placed in position they
commenced the construction of rifle-pits in their front.
Though wearied by three days of constant marching and
fighting, they gave themselves to the work with all the energy
of fresh men. Citizens and contrabands, also, were
pressed into the service. Many of the former were loyal
men, and devoted themselves to their tasks with a zeal which
evinced the interest they felt in making good the defence of
the town; but some of them were bitter rebels, and, as
Captain Poe well remarked, "worked with a very poor grace,
which blistered hands did not tend to improve." The contrabands
engaged in the work with that heartiness which,
during the war, characterized their labors in our service.</p>

<p>It was not till after his arrival in Knoxville that General
Burnside received a despatch from General Grant, dated
November 15th, two days before. It evinced the great
anxiety which the General felt in reference to events transpiring
in the vicinity of Knoxville. He said, "I do not know
how to impress on you the necessity of holding on to East
Tennessee in strong enough terms. It would seem that you
should, if pressed to do it, hold on to Knoxville, and that
portion of the valley you will necessarily possess, holding to
that point. Should Longstreet move his whole force across
the Little Tennessee, an effort should be made to cut his
pontoons on that stream, even if it sacrificed half the cavalry
of the Ohio army.... I should not think it advisable to concentrate
a force near the Little Tennessee to resist the crossing,
if it would be in danger of capture; but I would harass and
embarrass progress in every way possible, reflecting on the
fact that the Army of the Ohio is not the only army to resist
the onward progress of the enemy." On the same day this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
despatch was received, November 17th, General Grant sent
another to General Burnside. He said, "I have not heard
from you since the 14th. What progress is Longstreet
making, and what are your chances for defending yourself?"
Later, on the same day, Grant wrote, "Your despatch received.
You are doing exactly what appears to me to be
right. I want the enemy's progress retarded at every point,
all it can be, only giving up each place when it becomes evident
that it cannot longer be held without endangering your
force to capture." At ten o'clock that night Grant learned
of Burnside's return to Knoxville, and telegraphed to Halleck,
"Burnside speaks hopefully." On that day Grant
issued orders to Sherman and Thomas for the battle of
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Longstreet followed our troops very cautiously. At noon
his advance was a mile or two from our lines, and four
companies of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts&mdash;A, B, D,
G&mdash;were thrown out as skirmishers, the line extending
from the Holston river to the Kingston road. But the enemy
was held in check at some little distance from the town by
Sanders' division of cavalry. The hours thus gained for our
work in the trenches were precious hours indeed. There
was a lack of intrenching tools, and much remained to be
done; but all day and all night the men continued their
labor undisturbed, and on the morning of the 18th our line
of works around the town presented a formidable appearance.</p>

<p>Throughout the forenoon of that day there was heavy
skirmishing on the Kingston road; but our men&mdash;dismounted
cavalry&mdash;still maintained their position. Later in
the day, however, the enemy brought up a battery, which,
opening a heavy fire, soon compelled our men to fall back.
The rebels, now pressing forward, gained the ridge for which
they had been contending, and established their lines within
rifle range of our works. It was while endeavoring to check
this advance that General Sanders was mortally wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Our picket line was now advanced so as to make our position
as strong as possible. There was some firing on both sides
for a short time, and then all was quiet. The night that followed
was cold, but clear.</p>

<p>The enemy did not seem inclined to attack our position,
but proceeded to invest the town on the north bank of the
Holston. He then commenced the construction of a line of
works.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th the four companies of the
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts, which had been detailed for
picket duty on the morning of the 17th, were relieved by
the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania. The companies relieved were
ordered to College Hill to support Roemer's battery. While
on this duty the officers and men were quartered in the
buildings of East Tennessee College. Prior to our occupation
of East Tennessee these buildings had been used by the
rebels as a hospital; but, after a vigorous use of the ordinary
means of purification, they afforded us pleasant and comfortable
quarters.</p>

<p>The other companies of the Thirty-sixth&mdash;C, E, F, H, I,
K&mdash;took possession of the rifle-pits in front of the Powell
house, a short distance to the left of the Kingston road.
This was an elegant residence, built of brick, and when the
siege commenced fresco-painters were at work ornamenting
its parlors and halls. Throwing open its doors, Mr. Powell,
a true Union man, invited Colonel Morrison and Major
Draper to make it their head-quarters. He also designated a
chamber for the sick of our regiment. Early during the
siege the south-western and north-western fronts were loopholed
by order of General Burnside, and instructions were
given to post in the house, in case of an attack, two companies
of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts. When the order was
announced to Mr. Powell, he said, "All right. Lay this
house level with the ground, if it is necessary." A few feet
from the south-western front of the house a small earthwork
was thrown up by our men, in which was placed a section of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Buckley's battery. This work was afterwards known as
Battery Noble.</p>

<p>Throughout the siege both officers and men were on picket
duty every third day. During this twenty-four hours of duty
no one slept. The rest of the time we were on duty in the
trenches, where one-third, and sometimes one-fourth, of the
men were kept awake. The utmost vigilance was enjoined
upon all.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, day by day, and night by night, with unflagging
zeal, the troops gave themselves to the labor of strengthening
the works. Immediately in front of the rifle-pits a <i lang="fr">chevaux
de frise</i> was constructed. This was formed of pointed
stakes, thickly and firmly set in the ground, and inclining outwards
at an angle of about forty-five degrees. The stakes
were bound together with wire, so that they could not easily
be torn apart by an assaulting party. They were nearly five
feet in height. In front of Colonel Haskins' position, on the
north side of the town, the <i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i> was constructed
with the two thousand pikes which were captured at Cumberland
Gap early in the fall. A few rods in front of the
<i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i> was the <em>abatis</em>, formed of thick branches of
trees, which likewise were firmly set in the ground. Still
further to the front were wire entanglements, stretched a few
inches above the ground, and fastened here and there to
stakes and stumps. In front of a portion of our lines another
obstacle was formed by constructing dams across first and
second creeks, so called, and throwing back the water. The
whole constituted a series of obstacles which could not be
passed, in face of a heavy fire, without great difficulty and
fearful loss.</p>

<p>Morrison's brigade held the line of defences from the Holston
river&mdash;the extreme left of our line&mdash;to Fort Sanders.
The following was the position of the several regiments of
the brigade. The Forty-fifth Pennsylvania was on the left,
its left on the river. On its right was the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts.
Then came the Eighth Michigan. The Seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>-ninth
New York (Highlanders) formed the garrison of Fort
Sanders. Between the Eighth Michigan and Fort Sanders
was the One Hundredth Pennsylvania (Roundheads).</p>

<p>On the evening of November 20th the Seventeenth Michigan
made a sortie and drove the rebels from a house and
out-buildings on the Kingston road, a short distance from
Fort Sanders. It was a brick house, and afforded a near
and safe position for the enemy's sharp-shooters, who of late
had become somewhat annoying to the working parties at the
fort. The movement was a hazardous one, but was successfully
accomplished, with the loss of two men killed. This
sortie waked up the rebel batteries, and a few shells were
thrown into our lines; but soon all was quiet, and at length
the light of the burning buildings went out.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 21st the four right companies of
the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts,&mdash;A, B, D, G,&mdash;on duty at
the East Tennessee College, moved out to the rifle-pits.
The siege had now continued several days. The rebels had
constructed works, offensive and defensive, in our front; but
the greater part of their force seemed to have moved to the
right. On the 22d of November, however, they returned,
not having found evidently the weak place in our lines which
they sought. It was now thought they might attack our
front that night, and orders were given to the men on duty
in the outer works to exercise the utmost vigilance. But
the night&mdash;a beautiful moonlight night&mdash;passed quietly.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In his official report General Longstreet says: "On the 22d General McLaws
seemed to think his line near enough for an assault, and he was ordered to make it
at dark on that night. General Jenkins was ordered to be prepared to coöperate.
After night General McLaws reported against the assault, saying that his officers
would prefer to attack at daylight."</p></div>

<p>With each day our confidence in the strength of our position
increased, and we soon felt able to repel an assault from
any quarter. But the question of supplies was a serious one.
When the siege commenced there was in the Commissary
Department at Knoxville little more than a day's ration for
the whole army. Should the enemy gain possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
south bank of the Holston our only means of subsistence
would be cut off. Thus far his attempts in this direction
had failed, and the whole country from the French Broad to
the Holston, was open to our foraging parties. In this way
a considerable quantity of corn and wheat was soon collected
in Knoxville. Bread, made from a mixture of meal and
flour, was issued to the men, but only in half and quarter
rations. Occasionally a small quantity of fresh pork was
also issued. Neither sugar nor coffee was issued after the
first days of the siege.</p>

<p>The enemy, foiled in his attempts to seize the south bank
of the Holston, now commenced the construction of a raft
at Boyd's Ferry, above Knoxville. Floating this down the
swift current of the stream, he hoped to carry away our
pontoon, and thus cut off our communication with the
country beyond. To thwart this plan an iron cable, one
thousand feet in length, was stretched across the river above
the bridge. This was done under the direction of Captain
Poe. Afterwards a boom of logs, fastened end to end by
chains, was constructed still farther up the river. The boom
was fifteen hundred feet in length.</p>

<p>On the 23d the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts moved a little
to the left, in order to make room for another regiment in
the pits to our right. In the evening the rebels made an
attack on our pickets in front of the left of the Second Division,
Ninth Corps. In falling back our men fired the buildings
on the ground abandoned, lest they should become a
shelter for the enemy's sharp-shooters. Among the buildings
thus destroyed were the arsenal and machine-shops near the
depot. The light of the blazing buildings illuminated the
whole town.</p>

<p>The next day, November 24th, the Twenty-first Massachusetts
and the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania, the whole under
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Hawkes of the Twenty-first,
drove back the rebels at this point, and reoccupied our old
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the morning of the same day, an attack was
made by the Second Michigan&mdash;one hundred and ninety-seven
men&mdash;on the advanced parallel, which the enemy had
so constructed as to envelop the north-west bastion of Fort
Sanders. The works were gallantly carried; but, before the
supporting columns could come up, our men were repulsed
by fresh troops which the enemy had at hand. Our loss was
severe, amounting to sixty-seven, including Major Byington,
commanding the Second Michigan, who was left on the field
mortally wounded.</p>

<p>That night we had orders that neither officers nor men
should sleep. It was a long night of watching. There was
a total eclipse of the moon during the night, and we were in
shadow from two o'clock until four.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November the enemy, having on the
day previous crossed the Holston at a point below us,
made another unsuccessful attempt to occupy the heights
opposite Knoxville. He succeeded, however, in planting a
battery on a knob about one hundred and fifty feet above the
river, and twenty-five hundred yards south of Fort Sanders.
This position commanded Fort Sanders, so that it now became
necessary to defilade the fort.</p>

<p>November 26th was our national Thanksgiving day, and
General Burnside issued an order, in which he expressed the
hope that the day would be observed by all, as far as military
operations would allow. He knew that the rations were
short, and that the day would be unlike the joyous festival
we were wont to celebrate in our distant New England homes;
and so he reminded us of the circumstances of trial under
which our fathers first observed the day. He also reminded
us of the debt of gratitude which we owed to Him who during
the year had not only prospered our arms, but had kindly
preserved our lives. Accordingly we ate our corn bread
with thanksgiving; and, forgetting our own privations, thought
only of the loved ones at home, who, uncertain of our fate,
would that day find little cheer at the table and by the fireside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the bastion-work known
as Fort Sanders, which was named for the gallant commander
of the cavalry who laid down his life in front of
Knoxville at the beginning of the siege. A more particular
description of this fort is now needed. The main line, held
by our troops, made almost a right angle at the fort, the
north-west bastion being the salient of the angle. The
ground in front of the fort, from which the wood had been
cleared, sloped gradually for a distance of eighty yards, and
then abruptly descended to a wide ravine. Under the direction
of Lieutenant Benjamin, Second United States Artillery,
and Chief of Artillery of the Army of the Ohio, the fort
had now been made as strong as the means at his disposal
and the rules of military art admitted. Eighty and thirty
yards in front of the fort rifle-pits were constructed. These
were to be used in case our men were driven in from the
outer line. Between these pits and the fort were wire entanglements,
running from stump to stump, and also an <em>abatis</em>.
Sand-bags and barrels were arranged so as to cover the embrasures.
Traverses, also, were built for the protection of
the guns, and in passing from one position to another. In
the fort were four twenty-pounder Parrotts (Benjamin's battery),
four light twelve-pounders (of Buckley's battery),
and two three-inch steel rifle-guns.</p>

<p>November 27th all was quiet along the lines, except an
occasional shot from the rebel pickets, until evening, when
cheers and strains of music enlivened the enemy's camp.
We now know that the arrival of two brigades of Buckner's
command, reinforcements from Bragg's army, was the occasion
of their rejoicing; but at the time we could not solve
the mystery. Was it possible that Grant had met with a
reverse? we hesitatingly asked. Or had the enemy received
reinforcements? While on picket that night our men could
distinctly hear the rebels chopping on the knob that they
had so recently occupied on the opposite bank of the river.
They were clearing away the trees in front of the earthwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
which they had constructed the day before. Would they
attack at daybreak? So we thought, connecting the fact
with the cheers and music of the earlier part of the night;
but the morning opened as quietly as any of its predecessors.
Late in the afternoon the enemy seemed to be placing his
troops in position in our front, and our men stood in the
trenches awaiting an attack; yet the day wore away without
further demonstrations.</p>

<p>A little after eleven o'clock P.M., November 28th, we
were called to our places in the trenches by heavy musketry
to the right. It was a cloudy, dark night, and at a distance
of only a few feet it was impossible to distinguish any object.
The firing soon ceased, with the exception of an occasional
shot on the picket line. An attack had evidently been
made on our rifle-pits; but at what precise point, or with what
success, was as yet unknown. Reports soon came in. The
enemy had first driven in the pickets in front of Fort Sanders,
and had then attacked our line, which was also obliged
to fall back. The rebels in front of the Thirty-sixth, however,
did not advance beyond the pits which our men had
just vacated, and a new line was at once established by Captain
Buffum, of Company D, our brigade officer of the day.
We afterwards learned that the enemy had advanced along
the whole line and established themselves as near as possible
to our works.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the enemy intended an attack;
but where would it be made? All that long, cold night&mdash;our
men were without overcoats&mdash;we stood in the trenches
pondering that question. Might not this demonstration in
our front be only a feint to draw our attention from other
parts of the line, where the chief blow was to be struck?
So some thought. Gradually the night wore away.</p>

<p>A little after six o'clock the next morning the enemy
suddenly opened a furious cannonade. This was mostly
directed against Fort Sanders; but several shells struck the
Powell House, in rear of Battery Noble. Roemer immedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ately
responded from College Hill. In about twenty minutes
the enemy's fire slackened, and in its stead rose the well-known
rebel yell in the direction of the fort. Then followed
the rattle of musketry, the roar of cannon, and the bursting
of shells. The yells died away, and then rose again. Now
the roar of musketry and artillery was redoubled. It was
a moment of the deepest anxiety. Our straining eyes were
fixed on the fort. The rebels had reached the ditch, and
were now endeavoring to scale the parapet. Whose will be
the victory,&mdash;oh, whose? The yells again died away, and
then followed three loud Union cheers,&mdash;"Hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah!" How those cheers thrilled our hearts, as we stood
almost breathless at our posts in the trenches! They told
us that the enemy had been repulsed, and that the victory
was ours. Peering through the rising fog toward the fort,
not a hundred yards away,&mdash;oh, glorious sight!&mdash;we dimly
saw that our flag was still there.</p>

<p>Let us now go back a little. Longstreet had learned of
the defeat of Bragg, and, in opposition to the advice of his
generals, determined to make an assault on General Burnside's
lines. "Our only safety," he said to them, "is in making
the assault on the enemy's position." Port Sanders was
made the point of attack, as it was evidently the key of the
defences. Accordingly, having seized our rifle-pits, Longstreet,
under the cover of the ridge on which Fort Sanders
was built, formed his columns for the assault. The men
were picked men,&mdash;the flower of his corps. "The force
which was to attempt an enterprise which ranks with the
most famous charges in military history," says Pollard,
in his "Third Year of the War," pages 161, 162,
"should be mentioned in detail. It consisted of three
brigades of McLaws' division: that of General Wolford,
the Sixteenth, Eighteenth, and Twenty-fourth Georgia Regiments,
and Cobb's and Phillip's Georgia Legions; that of
General Humphrey, the Thirteenth, Seventeenth, Twenty-first,
Twenty-second, and Twenty-third Mississippi Regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>ments;
and a brigade composed of General Anderson's and
Bryant's brigades, embracing, among others, the Palmetto
State Guard, the Fifteenth South Carolina Regiment, and the
Fifty-first, Fifty-third, and Fifty-ninth Georgia Regiments."
One brigade was to make the assault, two brigades were to
support it, and two brigades were to watch our lines and
keep up a constant fire. Five regiments formed the brigade
selected for the assaulting column. These were placed in
position "in column by division, closed in mass." When
the fire of their artillery slackened, the order for the charge
was given. The salient of the north-west bastion was the
point of attack. The rebel lines were much broken in passing
the <em>abatis</em>. But the wire entanglements proved a
greater obstacle. Whole companies were prostrated. Benjamin
now opened his triple-shotted guns. Nevertheless,
the weight of their column carried the rebels forward, and
in two minutes from the time the charge was commenced
they had reached the ditch around the fort, and were endeavoring
to scale the parapet. The guns, which had been trained
to sweep the ditch, now opened a most destructive fire.
Lieutenant Benjamin also took shells in his hand, and, lighting
the fuse, tossed them over the parapet into the crowded
ditch. "It stilled them down," he said. One of the rebel
brigades in reserve, with added yells, now came up in support,
and the slaughter was renewed. The ditch was filled,
and several rebel flags were planted on the parapet. But
the Highlanders and the Twenty-ninth Massachusetts Volunteers
in the fort swept off with their muskets those who
attempted to scale the parapet. The men in the ditch, satisfied
of the hopelessness of the task they had undertaken,
now surrendered. They represented eleven regiments, and
numbered nearly three hundred. Among them were seventeen
commissioned officers. Over two hundred dead and
wounded, including three colonels, lay in the ditch alone.
The body of General Humphrey was found near the ditch,
while the ground in front of the fort was strewn with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
bodies of the dead and wounded. Over one thousand stands
of arms fell into our hands, and the battle-flags of the
Thirteenth and Seventeenth Mississippi and Sixteenth Georgia.
Our loss was eight men killed and five wounded.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Never was a victory more complete, and achieved at so slight
a cost. Never, too, were brighter laurels won than were
laid that morning on the brow of the hero of Fort Sanders,
Lieutenant Benjamin, Second United States Artillery.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

and men killed, 850 wounded, 248 missing; total 1,296. His loss in the assault

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The following account of this assault is taken from a history of the Sixtieth Alabama
Regiment, published at Montgomery, Ala., in 1867:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"At about three or four o'clock in the morning the regiment was gotten under
arms. The atmosphere was damp and penetratingly cold; the men were thinly clad,
and numbers of them barefoot. Their sufferings while standing under arms, clasping
with numbed hands the cold barrels of their muskets, can be appreciated by those
alone who have experienced similar hardships. But, despite of cold, hunger, nakedness,
and approaching peril, the brave fellows were full of spirit, and stout hearts beat
hopefully beneath each ragged gray jacket. General Gracie, while riding through his
brigade on the day before, had pointed significantly towards Knoxville, and remarked,
'There are shoes over there, boys,' and visions of comfortable brogans were floating
through the minds of those barefoot Confederates.
</p>
<p>
"There was no noise, save the low hum of subdued voices, the rumbling of moving
artillery, and the steady tramp of different bodies of troops advancing to their allotted
positions. The night was dark; but the enemy, anticipating our movement, filled the
heavens with streams of artificial light, which threw the shadow of our columns far to
the rear, and was reflected back by many an unsheathed sword and burnished barrel.
</p>
<p>
"At length, the ominous silence was broken by the discharge of a single piece of
artillery from the brow of a hill to our right. Artillery had been planted on each of
the hill-tops in the vicinity,&mdash;some being occupied by the enemy, and some by ourselves,&mdash;and
now, in a few moments after the discharge of this pioneer piece, a brisk
fire was opened from them all. Thunder peals burst forth and answered each other
in quick succession; and, like destroying angels, the huge missiles flew through the
dense atmosphere with an unearthly shrieking. Under the exhilaration of this stirring
martial serenade, and the animating words of the colonel of the regiment (who
seemed everywhere present), the line was put in motion, and, encountering a creek,
plunged through, regardless of the cold.
</p>
<p>
"After ascending a hill, and advancing a few hundred yards in the open field beyond,
the command was suddenly ordered to fall back, and accordingly faced about
and moved in retreat to the brow of the hill just passed, where it occupied a line of
rifle-pits located at that point. This retrograde movement, suggestive of ill, and at
first inexplicable, was soon accounted for in a manner that filled every heart with sorrow,
and shrouded every countenance in gloom. We had been in the rifle-pits but a
short time when day began to dawn. The firing ceased for the most part; only a stray
shell now and then ricocheted through our line, or burst above our heads. While thus
waiting in the rifle-pits, expecting, with much solicitude, the denouement, a solitary litter
was seen advancing toward us over the field in our front; then another and another,
and anon a sad procession was silently threading its way to the rear. No
words were required to convey the sad tidings. The blood dripping from the litters,
and the occasional groans of their mangled occupants, who had led in the charge, as
they passed through our line on their way to the rear, apprised us, more unmistakably
than language could have done, of the woful fact of the morning's disaster. The
charge, though gallant, was unsuccessful, and five hundred noble Mississippians lay
dead or dying in the moat that surrounded the fort upon which the attack had been
made. A truce had been early secured, and all day long the sad procession moved
on, silently and mournfully, in the discharge of its duty.
</p>
<p>
"Among the many inexpressibly sad days of our military career, no member of
the regiment will, I am sure, fail to recognize this, the 29th day of November, 1863,
as one of the most sad. All through that dismal day the words were ever recurring&mdash;'These

<p>Our only loss in the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts was private
Haven, of Company G, who died of wounds received from
a shell.</p>

<p>Longstreet had promised his men that they should dine
that day in Knoxville. But, in order that he might bury his
dead, General Burnside now tendered him an armistice
until five o'clock P.M. It was accepted, and our ambulances
were sent to assist the rebels in removing the bodies to the
enemy's lines. At five o'clock two additional hours were
asked, as the work was not yet completed. At seven o'clock
a gun was fired from Fort Sanders, the rebels responded
from an earthwork opposite, and the truce was at an end.</p>

<p>General Longstreet, in his official report, says: "On the
26th and 27th we had various rumors of a battle having been
fought at Chattanooga, the most authentic being from telegraph
operators. There seemed to be so many reports leading
to the same conclusion that I determined that I must
attack, and, if possible, get possession of Knoxville. The
attack upon the fort was ordered on the 28th, but, in
order to get our troops nearer the works, the assault was
postponed until daylight of the 29th. The line of sharp-shooters
along our entire front were ordered to be advanced
at dark to within good rifle-range of the enemy's lines, and
to sink rifle-pits during the night in their advanced positions,
so that the sharp-shooters along our whole line might engage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>the enemy upon an equal footing, whilst our columns made
the assault against the fort. Our advance at night was very
successful, capturing sixty or seventy prisoners without any
loss. The assault was ordered to be made by three of General
McLaws' brigades, his fourth being held in readiness for
further operations. General Jenkins was ordered to advance
a brigade a little later than the assaulting columns, and to
pass the enemy's lines east of the fort, and to continue the
attack along the enemy's rear and flank. Two brigades of
Major-General Buckner's division, under Brigadier-General
B. R. Johnson, having arrived the day before, were ordered
to move in rear of General McLaws, and, at a convenient
distance, to be thrown in, as circumstances might require.
On the night of the 28th General McLaws' letter of that
date was received. General McLaws' letter was shown to
General Leadbetter, and my answer was read to him.
General Leadbetter then suggested the postscript which I
added to the answer. The assault was made, at the appointed
time, by Generals Wofford's, Humphrey's, and Byron's brigades.
The troops were not formed as well to the front as
they should have been. Their lines should have been formed
close upon our line of rifle-pits, which would have given
them about two hundred yards to advance under fire. Instead
of this, the lines were formed several hundred yards in
rear of the pits. My orders were that the advance should
be made quietly until they entered the works, which was to
be announced by a shout. The troops moved up in gallant
style. As I approached the troops they seemed to be in
good order at the edge of the ditch, and some of the colors
appeared to be on the works. When in about five hundred
yards of the fort I saw some of our men straggling back,
and heard that the troops could not pass the ditch for want
of ladders or other means. Almost at the same moment I
saw that the men were beginning to retire in considerable
numbers, and very soon the column broke up entirely and
fell back in confusion. I ordered Buckner's brigades halted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and retired, and sent the order for Anderson's brigade, of
Hood's division, to be halted and retired; but the troops of
the latter brigade had become excited, and rushed up to the
same point from which the others had been repulsed, and
were soon driven back. Officers were sent to rally the men,
and good order was soon restored."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

permitted the writer, when in Richmond, Va., in April, 1880, to copy from General
Longstreet's letter-book two letters, which are of interest in this connection. The
first is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Head-quarters</span>, Nov. 28, 1863.<br />
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">General</span>,&mdash;Your letter is received. I am not at all confident that General Bragg
has had a serious battle at Chattanooga; but there is a report that he has, and fallen
back to Tunnel Hill. Under this report I am entirely convinced that our only safety
is in making the assault upon the enemy's position to-morrow at daylight; and it is
the more important that I should have the entire support, and all the force that you
may be possessed of, in the execution of my views. It is a great mistake to suppose
that there is any safety for us in going to Virginia, if General Bragg has been
defeated, for we leave him at the mercy of his victors; and with his army destroyed,
our own had better be also, for we must not only be destroyed, but disgraced. There
is neither safety nor honor in any other course than the one that I have already
chosen and ordered.

<p>
The second letter is as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Head-quarters</span>, Nov. 28, 1863.<br />
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">General</span>,&mdash;Your letter is received. The work of the enemy is not enclosed.
The ditch is probably at some points not more than three feet deep, and five or six
feet wide. At least, we so judged it yesterday in looking at a man walk down the
parapet and over the ditch. I thought that you saw the man, as you had been with
us. I have no apprehension of the result of the attack, if we go at it with a determination
to accomplish it. We should avail ourselves of everything, however, that may
aid or relieve us.
</p>
<p>
"After our first brigade has gained the enemy's lines, I desire that it should wheel
to the left, and pursue the attack to the left along the enemy's rear, and on to his
right, and your other brigade should conform to this movement. Johnson's division
will be ordered to follow it.
</p>
<p>
"Keep your men well at their work, and don't listen to the idea of failing, and we
shall not fail. If we go in with the idea that we shall fail, we will be sure to do so.
But no men who are determined to succeed can fail.
</p>
<p>
"Let me urge you not to entertain such feelings for a moment. Don't let any one
fail, or anything.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>We spent the day following the attack on Fort Sanders in
strengthening our rifle-pits. The lines were now much nearer
to those of the enemy. In some places not more than one
hundred yards separated them. Our shells troubled the
rebels when they relieved their picket in the forenoon. In
the afternoon we received official notice of Bragg's defeat at
Chattanooga. The night that followed was bitter cold, and
our thinly clad men suffered much.</p>

<p>The next day, December 1st, General Burnside issued an
order thanking his troops for their endurance and bravery,
and congratulating them on their recent successes, and the
success of Grant at Chattanooga. At noon, by order, a
single gun&mdash;we were short of ammunition&mdash;was fired from
Battery Noble, and the troops, standing in the trenches,
gave three cheers for the victories we had won. They were
hearty cheers, as the rebels across the ravine could testify.
And they knew, too, what those cheers meant. Having defeated
Bragg, General Grant was hurrying troops forward to
relieve the besieged in Knoxville. Finding General Granger,
whom he had selected for that task, lacking in energy, he
turned the command over to General Sherman, November
29th, with orders to push on as rapidly as possible.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>same time he sent a despatch to General Burnside congratulating
him on the tenacity with which he had held out against
vastly superior forces, and informing him of the movements
in progress for his relief. By order of General Grant a
copy of this despatch was suffered to fall into the enemy's
hands, and from it, December 1st, Longstreet learned of
Sherman's advance. Burnside did not receive the despatch
till the following day. Longstreet now saw that the siege must
be raised at once, and he made his preparations accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</p>
<p>
News was received from Knoxville to the morning of the 27th. At that time the
place was still invested, but the attack on it was not vigorous. Longstreet is evidently
determined to starve the garrison out; Granger is on the way to Burnside's relief, but
I have lost all faith in his energy or capacity to manage an expedition of the importance
of this one. I am inclined to think, therefore, I shall have to send you. Push
as rapidly as you can to the Tennessee, and determine for yourself what force to take
with you from that point; Granger has his corps with him, from which you will
select in conjunction with the force now with you. In plain words, you will assume
command of all the forces now moving up the Tennessee, including the garrison at
Kingston, and from that force organize what you deem proper to relieve Burnside.
The balance send back to Chattanooga. Granger has a boat loaded with provisions,
which you can issue, and return the boat; I will have another loaded to follow you.
Use, of course, as sparingly as possible from the rations taken with you, and subsist off
the country all you can.
</p>
<p>
It is expected that Foster is moving, by this time, from Cumberland Gap, on Knoxville.
I do not know what force he will have with him, but presume it will range
from three thousand five hundred to five thousand. I leave this matter to you, knowing
that you will do better acting upon your discretion than you could trammelled with
instructions. I will only add, that the last advices from Burnside himself indicated
his ability to hold out with rations only to about the 3d of December.
</p>
<p class="right">
Very respectfully,<br />
U. S. GRANT, <em>Major General Commanding</em>.<br />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> In his report, General Longstreet says: "As our position at Knoxville was
somewhat complicated, I determined to abandon the siege, and to draw off in the
direction of Virginia, with an idea that we might find an opportunity to strike that
column of the enemy's forces reported to be advancing by Cumberland Gap. The
orders to move in accordance with this view were issued on the 2d of December."</p></div>

<p>December 2d it was rumored that General Burnside's
resignation of his command had been accepted at Washington,
and that he was to be relieved by General Foster, who
was said to be at Tazewell,&mdash;a rumor by no means pleasing
to the Ninth Corps. At nine o'clock in the evening there
was an alarm, and we stood in our places in the trenches
expecting an attack.</p>

<p>On the following day the enemy were very quiet, and we
thought there were some indications that they were preparing
to raise the siege. The number of their pickets was
manifestly less than usual. The fact was that their wagon-trains
were that day put in motion, and on the night of December
4th the rebels withdrew from their lines around
Knoxville, crossed the Holston, and moved up the north
bank of the river. The retreat was discovered early in the
morning by the pickets of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts,
under Captain Ames, of Company B, who had the honor of
first reporting that the siege of Knoxville was raised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>Sherman was then at Marysville, and December 5th sent
the following note to Burnside: "I am here, and can bring
twenty-five thousand men into Knoxville to-morrow; but
Longstreet having retreated, I feel disposed to stop, for a
stern chase is a long one. But I will do all that is possible.
Without you specify that you want troops, I will let mine
rest to-morrow, and ride in to see you." Accordingly Sherman
halted his troops, except two of Granger's divisions, and
December 6th he entered Knoxville, and reported in person
to General Burnside.</p>

<p>In his official report General Sherman says: "On the morning
of December 6th I rode from Marysville into Knoxville,
and met General Burnside. General Granger arrived later in
the day. We examined his lines of fortifications, which were
a wonderful production for the short time allowed in their
selection of ground and construction of work. It seemed
to me that they were nearly impregnable. We examined
the redoubt named 'Sanders,' where, on the Sunday previous,
three brigades of the enemy had assaulted and met a bloody
repulse. Now, all was peaceful and quiet; but a few hours
before the deadly bullet sought its victims all round about
that hilly barrier."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The emergency having passed, General Burnside was of
the opinion that General Sherman should return to Grant,
leaving Granger's command. The necessary orders were
given, and General Sherman put his columns in motion southward
again. Too much praise cannot be awarded to General
Sherman for the promptness with which he came to our
relief; as General Burnside said, it was Sherman's approach
that raised the siege.</p>

<p>In his official report of this campaign General Grant said:
"The armies of the Cumberland and Tennessee, for their
energy and unsurpassed bravery in the three days' battle
of Chattanooga, their patient endurance in marching to
the relief of Knoxville, and the army of the Ohio, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
its masterly defence of Knoxville and repeated repulses of
Longstreet's assaults upon that place, are deserving of the
gratitude of their country." That gratitude they received.
Thanks to Grant and his officers and men were voted by
Congress, and a gold medal was struck, to be presented by
the President to General Grant "in the name of the people
of the United States of America." It was also voted that
"The thanks of Congress be, and they hereby are, presented
to Major-General Ambrose E. Burnside, and through him to
the officers and men who have fought under his command,
for their gallantry, good conduct, and soldier-like endurance."
On the 7th of December President Lincoln issued
a proclamation referring to the raising of the siege of
Knoxville, "under circumstances rendering it probable that
the Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important
position," and recommending that "all loyal people
do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their places of
worship, and render special homage and gratitude to Almighty
God for this great advancement of the national cause."</p>

<p>The noble bearing of General Burnside throughout the
siege won the admiration of all his troops. December 11th
he transferred the command of the Department of the Ohio
to General Foster, the announcement of which was made in
the following order:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

<span class="smcap">Head-quarters Army of the Ohio,<br />
Knoxville, Tenn.</span>, Dec. 11, 1863.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">General Field Orders No. 38.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In obedience to orders from the War Department, the Commanding
General this day resigns to Major-General John G.
Foster the command of the Army of the Ohio.</p>

<p>On severing the tie which has united him to this gallant army
he cannot express his deep personal feeling in parting from men
brought near to him by their mutual experiences in the eventful
scenes of the past campaign, and who have always, regardless of
every privation and of every danger, cheerfully and faithfully
performed their duty. Associated with many of their number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
from the earliest days of the war, he takes leave of the army not
only as soldiers, to whose heroism many a victorious battle-field
bears witness, but as well-tried friends, who in the darkest hours
have never failed him. With the sincerest regret he leaves the
department without the opportunity of personally bidding them
farewell.</p>

<p>To the citizen soldiers of East Tennessee, who proved their
loyalty in the trenches of Knoxville, he tenders his warmest
thanks.</p>

<p>With the highest confidence in the patriotism and skill of the
distinguished officer who succeeds him, with whom he has been
long and intimately connected in the field, and who will be welcome
as their leader by those who served with him in the memorable
campaign in North Carolina, and by all as one identified with
some of the most brilliant events of the war, he transfers to him
the command, assured that under his guidance the bright record
of the Army of the Ohio will never grow dim.</p>

<p class="right">
By command of Major-General <span class="smcap">Burnside</span>,<br />
LEWIS RICHMOND, <em>A.A.G.</em><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In a speech at Cincinnati, a few days after, with that modesty
which characterizes the true soldier, Burnside said that
the honors bestowed on him belonged to his under-officers and
the men in the ranks. Those kindly words his officers and
men will ever cherish; and in all their added years, as they
recall the widely separated battle-fields, made forever sacred
by the blood of their fallen comrades, and forever glorious by
the victories there won, it will be their pride to say, "We
fought with Burnside at Campbell's Station and in the trenches
at Knoxville."</p>

<p>The following general orders are inserted as a fitting conclusion
to this chapter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

</p>

<p>The General Commanding has again the proud pleasure of congratulating
the officers and men of this division upon their splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
behavior. During the campaign of the last three weeks they have
endured privations and fatigue that soldiers are seldom called
upon to experience.</p>

<p>Leaving their comfortable quarters at Lenoir's at a moment's
notice and seeking the enemy in his own camp; the return to
Lenoir's, and checking him at that place; the rapid march to
Campbell's Station, at which place they repulsed with heavy loss a
superior force; the wearying night march, after a hard day's
march and fight, to this place, where, hemmed in for nearly three
weeks by a large army full of determination to drive us from East
Tennessee or capture us,&mdash;they have borne the brunt of nearly all
the fighting, and endured days and nights of labor and watching,
on a scanty allowance of provisions, without complaint.</p>

<p>The conduct of those who were fortunate enough to be of the
small number that repulsed the determined assault on Fort Sanders,
on the 29th, ult. cannot be too highly praised. They drove back
two brigades of the enemy with terrible slaughter, captured three
stands of colors, and maintained the high reputation of their
division. Fortunate is the country that can produce such soldiers,
and proud of his position is the general commanding them.</p>

<p>Our work is not yet done. We will be called on to fight more
battles and probably to endure more hardships. Let us go forward
with strong hearts and willing hands, and we cannot fail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

SUBSEQUENT MOVEMENTS IN EAST TENNESSEE.</h2>


<p>There was some delay in following up the retreating
enemy. On the morning of December 7th, however, we
were called early, and notified that orders had been received
to march at seven o'clock. At that hour we were in motion,
marched through the town, and advanced twelve miles on
the Newmarket road, the whole of the Ninth Corps with
us. About two o'clock we went into camp, found plenty of
forage, and built good fires. The march was continued on
the 8th; and on the 9th, shortly after noon, we went into
camp about a mile south of Rutledge.</p>

<p>December 11th, while we were still near Rutledge, Lieutenant
Hodgkins, who had been home on leave of absence and
detached service at Cumberland Gap, rejoined the regiment,
and brought not a little cheer to all hearts by the announcement
that a large mail and supplies were at Tazewell. The
supply-train arrived on the 13th, and once again we had a
taste of bread, coffee, and sugar. The mail reached us on
the following day.</p>

<p>We had orders during the night to be ready to march at
early dawn; yet the 14th passed and we still remained at
Rutledge. But there was trouble ahead. Longstreet had
attacked our cavalry at Bean's Station, and had compelled it
to fall back, leaving a wagon-train in his hands. At the close
of the day we had orders to march at a moment's notice.
About midnight a part of the Twenty-third Corps passed our
camp, moving to the front.</p>

<p>December 15th tents were struck soon after breakfast, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
about eleven o'clock we moved back a few hundred rods and
formed in line of battle. There we remained during the day,
ready for the enemy if he should appear, and about nine
o'clock in the evening we took the road to Knoxville. On
account of the bad state of the roads we were nearly six hours
marching six miles. It was a bitter cold night, and the men
built fires of fence-rails at our numerous halts. At length
we bivouacked in a field at the roadside, where we managed
to get about an hour's sleep in front of our fires.</p>

<p>About half-past nine, December 15th, we renewed our
march, and halted at noon at Blain's Cross Roads. The enemy
followed, and there was some skirmishing at the outposts.
About three o'clock in the afternoon we formed a line of battle,
and constructed a breastwork of rails. Companies A
and B, of the Thirty-sixth, were sent out on picket. But
the enemy did not attempt to advance. Indeed, as we soon
learned, Longstreet withdrew his forces to the other side of
the Holston, and, marching to Morristown, ordered his men
to make themselves comfortable for the winter.</p>

<p>We, too, at Blain's Cross Roads, which has well been called
the Valley Forge of the Rebellion, endeavored to make ourselves
comfortable; but it was not an easy matter. Very
few of our men had overcoats; indeed, they were poorly
clothed in every respect. For the lack of shoes many were
obliged to protect their feet with moccasins made of rawhide.
Rations, too, were short. A few spoonfuls of flour
were served out as the daily allowance, and, had it not been
for the corn picked up here and there, sometimes where the
mules were corralled, the men would have suffered severely.
Foraging parties were sent out on every hand, but the natives
generally "were plumb out"; there was "not a dust of meal"
in the house, they said.</p>

<p>December 27th we moved our camp a short distance, and
built as comfortable houses as the means at hand would allow.
The days that followed were uneventful, for the most part.
January 8th the Eighth Michigan started home, the men hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ing
reënlisted on the promise of a furlough. The One
Hundredth Pennsylvania followed January 12th. No more
inspiring sight can be imagined than that of the remnant of a
once full regiment at the expiration of its three years of service,
and living on quarter rations of corn-meal, with occasionally
a handful of flour, standing forth under the open
skies amid a thousand discomforts, and, raising loyal hands
toward heaven, swearing to serve the country yet three years
longer!</p>

<p>January 15th clothing arrived and was issued. Though the
quantity was small, there was enough to be of much benefit
to our shivering men. On the following day the Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania started home, its term of service also having
nearly expired. At ten o'clock we broke camp and marched
to Strawberry Plains, about sixteen miles north of Knoxville.
It is at this place that the railroad crosses the Holston river.
We went into camp, and on the following day built houses.</p>

<p>But on the 17th there were rumors of an approach of the
enemy, and we had orders to march the next morning at seven.
When the morning came, however, these orders were countermanded,
and we were then ordered to hold ourselves in
readiness to march at a moment's notice. That night two or
three inches of snow fell. On the following day, January
19th, we remained at our quarters until night, when we were
ordered to the station to load cars with batteries and ammunition.
January 21st no rations, except of fresh beef, or rather
of bones, as the men said, were issued. About midnight we
were ordered to be ready to march at daybreak. Wagons
came at two o'clock, and our baggage was packed and sent off
to Knoxville. About noon on that day, the 21st, we moved
into the woods. Not long after, the rebels appeared on the
opposite side of the river and opened fire from a battery, to
which our guns responded. No rations were issued that day,
but our men obtained some corn and pork which the Twenty-third
Corps Commissary had left at the station. The bridge
across the river was destroyed by our troops, also about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
forty wagons. Early the next morning we set out for Knoxville,
Morrison's brigade forming the rear guard. The rebel
cavalry followed us closely, and we were obliged to form in
line of battle frequently, and offer fight, in order to keep the
enemy at a respectful distance. Late in the afternoon we
halted about three miles from Knoxville, and bivouacked for
the night.</p>

<p>The next day, January 23d, the rebels retired and we moved
into the woods for protection from the cold. Here we hoped
to have a little rest; but in the morning&mdash;it was the Sabbath&mdash;we
found that a Sabbath-day's journey was before us.
We marched through Knoxville, passed Fort Sanders and
the trenches that the siege had made so familiar to us, and
went into camp near Erin's Station, about five miles from the
city.</p>

<p>Rumors now became rife that the Ninth Corps was soon to
leave Tennessee and go east, to be under the command once
more of General Burnside. The thought was an inspiring
one to both officers and men.</p>

<p>Having completed our camp preparations, company and
battalion drills were resumed January 27th. January 31st
the Thirty-sixth received about one hundred recruits from
the Twenty-ninth Massachusetts,&mdash;the portion of the regiment
that had not reënlisted. The remainder of their period of
service these men were to fill out with us. That evening
we received orders to be ready to march at a moment's
notice. We did not move, however, until late in the afternoon
of the following day, February 1st, when our whole
division marched through Knoxville, crossed the Holston,
and encamped on the heights beyond. It was very muddy,
and we had much difficulty in climbing the hills in the dark.
Our bivouac that night was a cheerless one, and the next
morning, it having been discovered by somebody that there
were no rebels within thirty miles, we were ordered back to
our camp at Erin's Station.</p>

<p>General Foster, about this time, asked to be relieved of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the command of the Department of the Ohio, on account of
the reöpening of an old wound; and February 9th General
J. M. Schofield reached Knoxville, having, at General
Grant's request, been appointed to succeed Foster.</p>

<p>February 15th we broke camp at Erin's Station in a pouring
rain, and marched to Knoxville, where we encamped
just outside of the city, and not far from Fort Sanders.
The rifle-pits occupied by the rebels during the siege extended
along the rear of our camp. The object in making this
change in such a storm was not apparent; and, as this was
our first acquaintance with General Schofield, the impression
received was not a very favorable one. Yet, like good
soldiers, we made ourselves as comfortable as the circumstances
would allow.</p>

<p>Three days later orders came for us to move in the afternoon.
This time it was a mile only, to a position between
the Jacksboro' and Tazewell roads. Here we had again
made ourselves as comfortable as possible when, February
20th, shortly after dress-parade, we received orders to be
ready to march at a moment's notice. The next morning we
were up early, the mules were harnessed to the wagons all
day; but night came, and we still remained in camp. February
22d most of the regiment were engaged in strengthening
the fortifications at Knoxville. On the following day Captain
Smith, Lieutenant Brigham, and ten men were detailed to
go to Massachusetts for recruits. At night we were told to
hold ourselves in readiness to march at daybreak, in light
marching order, with sixty rounds of ammunition per man.
This looked like business.</p>

<p>A little after sunrise the next morning, February 24th,
we left our camp, and took the road to Strawberry Plains,
General Willcox being in command of our division. On
the march we passed the Twenty-third Corps. General
Schofield and his staff accompanied the troops. We
marched about twenty miles, and at night encamped in
the woods three miles beyond the railway station at Straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>berry
Plains. On the following day we received orders to
lay out a camp, as it would be necessary for us to remain
where we were several days. A pontoon came up on the
train from Knoxville, and everything indicated a vigorous
movement against the enemy.</p>

<p>February 27th we broke camp about eight o'clock in the
morning, and marched to the river. As there was neither
time nor men to construct a pontoon bridge, preparations
had been made to carry the troops across the Holston in
barges. Two ropes were stretched from bank to bank,&mdash;a
distance of about one hundred yards,&mdash;and by means of these
the barges, filled with men, were drawn across the stream.
There were seven barges in all, and in less than three-quarters
of an hour our brigade was transferred to the opposite
shore. The passage of the entire command occupied the
whole forenoon. When we had crossed, we moved down the
road two miles and halted in an oak grove. Meanwhile our
supply train and artillery were crossing at the ford below.
Late in the afternoon, when we had pitched our tents for the
night, orders came for the regiment to pack up, as we had
been assigned to picket duty. So we packed up and moved
out to the front.</p>

<p>The next morning, Sunday, February 28th, nine deserters
came into our lines. They reported Longstreet as falling
back; said they were tired of the war, and that there was
much dissatisfaction in the rebel ranks. We marched about
eleven o'clock, Morrison's brigade in advance, and halted late
in the afternoon about a mile beyond Mossy Creek, having
advanced thirteen miles.</p>

<p>That night it rained, nor did the rain cease with the darkness.
We marched at seven in the morning, February 29th,
the rain still falling. The roads were very muddy, and we
had a toilsome, disagreeable march. Early in the afternoon
we reached Morristown,&mdash;a march of thirteen miles,&mdash;and
encamped just beyond the town. The ground was well-watered,
but we pitched our shelter-tents, obtained some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
boards from an old camp near by, and endeavored to make
ourselves comfortable for the night. A flag of truce came in
from the rebels, and it was understood that they were in force
about six miles distant.</p>

<p>We expected to advance the next morning, March 1st, but
it still rained in torrents. Our shelter-tents afforded little
protection in such a deluge, and officers and men drew
largely on the hospitality of the town in seeking comfortable
quarters. Some curious expressions were caught up from
the people in this region, and long lingered in the regiment.
A few of our men were at a farm-house, and, as they sat
down at the supper-table, the good mistress of the house
apologized for the quality of the fare in these terms: "Our
butter is gin out, but you can wobble your corndodgers in
the ham-fat if you choose." A forager asked a woman if
she had any molasses. "Well," she replied, "we haven't
many, but we have a few!"</p>

<p>To our great surprise, the next day, March 2d, we moved
back to Mossy Creek. Why, we knew not, as there was no
enemy threatening us. We reached Mossy Creek about ten
P.M., and encamped on the same spot where we pitched our
tents when on the way to Morristown. We were snug in our
blankets that night when orders came for us to be ready to
march at a moment's notice. A little after midnight Col.
Morrison rode up and startled us all with the order, "Fall in,
Thirty-sixth!" In less than five minutes we were on the march.
We moved down to the creek and there halted. The troops
of the Twenty-third Corps were crossing. Citizens and contrabands
had reported that Longstreet was advancing. We
built fires and awaited further orders. Not long after daylight
we returned to the camp we had left so suddenly.</p>

<p>March 5th a brigade of rebel cavalry was reported near,
and Companies B, C, and F of the Thirty-sixth went out on a
reconnoissance. After feeling of our position, however, the
cavalry left. While our men were out they were drawn up
in a line of battle under the brow of a hill, well concealed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Col. Morrison, who accompanied the scouting party, was a
slight distance in advance, reconnoitring, when a rebel lieutenant,
who had lost his reckoning, being overcome with
whiskey, rode up to the brow of the hill. The colonel drew
his revolver and ordered the drunken lieutenant to dismount.
He had on one of our overcoats, and when Gen. Parke came
up, not long after, he gave orders that it should be given to
one of our own men. A goodly-sized knife was the only
weapon that the lieutenant carried.</p>

<p>On the following day we again had orders to be ready to
march at a moment's notice. March 7th we changed our
camp, though we still remained at Mossy Creek.</p>

<p>Orders for a movement were received March 11th, and the
<em>reveillé</em> was sounded at three o'clock the next morning. We
marched at five, Morrison's brigade having the advance. It
was a beautiful winter's day, and we reached Morristown
about eleven o'clock. Passing through the town, we encamped
about two miles beyond, on the Chucky Valley road.
The railroad bridge at Strawberry Plains had now been repaired,
and the trains were running to Morristown.</p>

<p>March 13th we had a quiet Sunday, and were to have a
brigade dress-parade at night, when word came from our cavalry
pickets that the rebels had appeared. The Thirty-sixth
was ordered out in the direction indicated; but the enemy had
already retired, and we returned to our camp.</p>

<p>The next morning our cavalry had a short fight. One
rebel was killed, two were wounded, and nine were taken
prisoners. About eleven o'clock we had orders to fall in,
and our brigade moved out on the Chucky Valley road.
The Seventy-ninth New York was left at the cross-roads,
about five miles from our camp. We halted at the river,
while the Twentieth Michigan, throwing off their knapsacks,
advanced a couple of miles further. The cavalry sent in one
prisoner. As he joined us he said he had never fought
against "you-uns." The Twentieth Michigan at length returned,
and the brigade marched back to Morristown, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
we arrived about dark. Several corn-cribs along the line of
march that day, and one especially at the river, added somewhat
to the daily ration.</p>

<p>The 15th was a cold, raw March day. Just at night
there was an alarm, and our brigade moved out hastily to
support the cavalry pickets; but we were not needed, and
soon returned to camp.</p>

<p>The following day brought a confirmation of the rumors
which for some time had been rife among us. The Ninth
Corps was ordered to Annapolis, Md., and we were to commence
our eastward journey on the morrow. We could
hardly credit the good news, and joy beamed in every
countenance. Had it been possible for us to forecast the
future our joy would have been considerably lessened.</p>

<p>March 17th the <em>reveillé</em> was sounded at four o'clock, and
we marched at six. It was a morning without clouds, and
we were all in excellent spirits. The Thirty-sixth Massachusetts
led the brigade; and as we left our old camp the
brigade band, which was with us, struck up a lively air, and
we were as happy almost as if we were marching homeward.
That night we encamped at Newmarket,&mdash;a march of twenty
miles.</p>

<p>The next morning the <em>reveillé</em> was sounded at half-past
four, and we marched at half-past six. Our brigade was
still in advance. We crossed the Holston, at Strawberry
Plains, on a pontoon. At half-past four we pitched our tents
seven miles from Knoxville, having marched nineteen miles.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we resumed our march, and about
half-past ten in the forenoon, having passed through Knoxville,
we encamped near Fort Sanders. That day and the
next we remained at Knoxville. We now learned that we
were to march over the mountains into Kentucky, leaving
the sick and the shoeless to be transported by cars. An
inspection of the regiment was accordingly ordered, and the
names of the men whose shoes were in such condition as not to
allow them to make so long a journey were placed in the list<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of those for whom transportation was to be furnished. The
rest&mdash;about two hundred officers and men&mdash;were the toughened
remnant of the one thousand who left Massachusetts a
year and a half before. All were animated with high hopes,
and the rough road before us was one which, even at that
inclement season of the year, we were exceedingly eager
to travel.</p>

<p>The next morning, March 21st, we took our last look of
scenes with which we had become so familiar since November
17th, and commenced our long march. The Thirty-sixth
Massachusetts led the corps. We advanced eighteen miles,
and encamped at Clinton.</p>

<p>The next day, in a snow-storm, we were ferried across the
Clinch river in scows. Then, in a raw wind and over icy
roads, we marched seventeen miles, and encamped about four
miles from Jacksboro'. Some of us remembered that it was
just a year before that we left Newport News. The next
morning, March 23d, we marched through Jacksboro', and
soon after commenced to ascend the mountains back of the
town. It was a beautiful sight, as the long line of troops
moved up the zigzag road, with muskets glittering in the bright
sunlight. We marched that day thirteen miles. March 24th
we advanced eighteen miles. The road led us up and down
mountains without number. The next morning snow covered
the ground. We marched at half-past six. About eleven
o'clock we reached the Kentucky line. Rain set in early,
but we pushed on and advanced eighteen miles. A rainy
night was followed by snow on the morning of March 26th.
During the forenoon the clouds broke and we had fair
weather. At noon we met a wagon-train, loaded with rations
which had been sent out to us from Camp Burnside. That
day we marched nineteen miles. The next morning, at
half-past six, we were again on the road, and about
ten o'clock we reached Camp Burnside. From Jacksboro'
to this place our march had led us through an almost
unbroken wilderness, and over the worst of roads, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
brooks and streams without number. Leaving Camp Burnside
we crossed the Cumberland river about noon, and
encamped that night about a mile beyond Somerset,
having marched sixteen miles. March 28th we advanced
eighteen miles, and encamped at Waynesborough. The next
day, a little past noon, we encamped at Hall's Gap, three
miles south of Stanford. Snow fell during the night.
March 30th we passed through Lancaster at noon, and at
night we pitched our tents not far from Camp Dick Robinson,
having advanced eighteen miles. The next morning we
marched at the usual hour, passed Camp Nelson about eleven
o'clock, and encamped three miles beyond. The Second
Brigade of our division took cars at Nicholasville in the afternoon.
In the morning, April 1st, we marched to Nicholasville
in a pouring rain. Cars arrived about eleven o'clock,
and we embarked at once. There were delays on the road, so
that we did not arrive at Covington until about midnight.
It was a cold, cheerless ride.</p>

<p>The next morning, April 2d, we marched to the barracks,
where we remained until the following day. Transportation
having at length been provided, we marched to the depot in
Cincinnati, where we took the train about eleven A.M. We
reached Columbus, O., about eleven P.M. There we were
notified that a lunch had been provided for the regiment; but
it proved to be a mean affair. At Steubenville, O., which
we reached about noon, April 4th, we found a large crowd
of ladies at the depot, with baskets of bread, cakes, and pies.
There we remained about an hour and a half. Resuming our
journey, we reached Pittsburgh, Penn., at midnight. Leaving
the cars, we marched to the City Hall, where a bountiful
collation had been prepared. The men had all they wanted,
and that, too, of the best. At three A.M. we were again on
the cars. We crossed the mountains in a snow-storm. Altoona
was reached about eleven o'clock. At nine o'clock A.M., April
6th, we were in Baltimore. The regiment marched to the rooms
of the relief committee and had breakfast. We remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the city until late in the afternoon, and reached Annapolis,
Md., about midnight. Our orders were to remain in the cars
until morning, when we went into camp just outside of the
town. The Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, which had rejoined the
corps, its furlough having expired, furnished the Thirty-sixth
with coffee on our arrival at the camp,&mdash;one of many
instances of friendly regard manifested toward us during the
war by our old companions in arms.</p>

<p>And so closed, not only our long journey, but a memorable
chapter in our history. What the future had in store for us
we little imagined.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

REORGANIZATION.</h2>


<p>The preceding chapters of this regimental history have
recorded the story of the year of preparation and discipline,
and the year of trial, suffering, and winnowing. We now
approach what may well be called the year of sacrifice and
martyrdom. We are to recount the story of the organization
so dear to all our hearts, so much, in fact, a portion of our
very existence, which was now to undergo its most fearful
trials, and, by the sacrifice of its noblest blood, to maintain
and enhance a reputation for courage and devotion which
had been won in summer's heat in the fields and swamps of
Mississippi, and in the winter's cold in the mountain wilds of
East Tennessee.</p>

<p>At Annapolis we found a large force encamped, the post
being commanded by Colonel Hartranft, of the Fifty-first
Pennsylvania Volunteers, as Provisional Commander. The
Ninth Army Corps, relieved from duty in the Department of
the Ohio, had been ordered to rendezvous at this place for
reorganization. On the 7th of January, soon after his departure
from East Tennessee, General Burnside was reassigned
to the command of the Ninth Corps, with instructions
to "recruit and fill up the old regiments," and to increase the
strength of the corps to fifty thousand men, for such service
as the War Department should especially designate. The
great popularity of General Burnside in New England, and
the other States represented in the old Ninth Corps, secured
the cordial coöperation of the authorities, and recruiting was
carried forward with gratifying success. Massachusetts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
pledged her four veteran infantry regiments, already in process
of organization, and all the New England States, Pennsylvania,
New York, and Michigan, sent forward many new
regiments which had been recruited during the winter under
the personal supervision of General Burnside. Although the
destination of this force remained a mystery, it was confidently
expected throughout the corps that General Burnside
was to be assigned to an independent command, and that a
coast expedition was to be organized. The general impression
prevailed that the corps was to be sent to North Carolina,
or to the Virginia peninsula to coöperate with the Army
of the Potomac in the campaign about to open. With this
prospect in view the men were highly elated.</p>

<p>The camp at Annapolis was delightful, and revived the
pleasant memories of Newport News and Camp Dick Robinson,&mdash;the
only places where we had ever "played soldier."
It was laid out with military precision, in accordance with
army regulations. The company streets were wide and well-policed,
the new white A tents were decorated with evergreen
and holly, and the grounds, laid out in tasty squares
and centre-pieces, presented a beautiful appearance. Contrasted
with what had preceded, and what was about to follow,
it was a genuine holiday camp,&mdash;a bright oasis in the
desert of a soldier's life. The burning sun of Mississippi,
the deadly malaria of the Yazoo, the freezing cold and corn-cob
rations of Tennessee, were soon forgotten in the general
happiness and comfort of this delightful camp. Following
those long and rigorous campaigns, the rest and abundant
rations were gratefully enjoyed. Many of the "absent sick"
who had been left in general hospitals in Kentucky and Ohio
to recover from the effects of the former severe campaigns,
returned to duty. New clothing and equipments were issued,
and the regiment soon regained something of its familiar appearance.
Company and regimental drills, inspections, parades,
and reviews, together with the work of reorganizing
and equipping the regiment, caused the time to pass rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and pleasantly. We were also visited by many citizens of
Massachusetts,&mdash;friends of the regiment,&mdash;who brought with
them, not cheering words only, but many substantial tokens
of the good-will and affectionate remembrance of the dear
ones at home. Here, also, many of the officers and men received
furloughs for a few days' visit home; and the fact is
worthy of record, that all the men who were accorded this
privilege returned promptly and cheerfully to duty.</p>

<p>In obtaining these furloughs some amusing incidents occurred.
One member of Co. B, impatient at the long delay
attending his application, determined to see "Old Burnie," as
he called him, in person, and plead his own cause. By a little
shrewd management, or strategy, as it was termed, he surprised
the General at his breakfast one Sunday morning.
Being outflanked, the General listened patiently to the veteran's
story, then called for the papers and endorsed on the
application, "Approved for seven days. A. E. Burnside,"
in characters that defied forgery, doubtless little dreaming
that this man was only a skirmisher from quite a line of
men outside, waiting to "see how the thing worked." The
happy soldier "retired in good order," and, as soon as the
success of his daring attack was known, the General's house
was besieged by many others who could not wait for "red
tape" and "regular channels." There were but few general
officers against whom it would be prudent or safe to advance
a second such line; but the boys said they knew their man,
and that "Burnside remembered Knoxville!"</p>

<p>On the 13th of April the entire corps then in camp was
reviewed by Generals Grant and Burnside. The day was
delightful, and, as they rode in front of the long, imposing
lines, greeted by cheers and strains of martial music, and the
waving of tattered and blood-stained banners, the enthusiasm
of the men was unbounded.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Lieut.-Col. Goodell, who had been with the
regiment during the journey from Cincinnati, was obliged,
on account of the troublesome nature of his wound, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
return to Massachusetts, receiving leave of absence for
fifteen days, leaving the regiment in command of Major
Draper.</p>

<p>On the 19th the corps was reorganized. The old First
Division, with which we had been identified during all our
service, was almost entirely broken up. General Ferrero, our
former commander, was assigned to command the new Fourth
Division, composed entirely of colored troops, and most of
the regiments were assigned to the new Second and Third
Divisions. The new First Division was composed chiefly of
regiments recently organized, and those not previously connected
with the corps. The Seventy-ninth New York, One
Hundredth Pennsylvania, and Seventeenth Michigan, were
sent to the Third Division, commanded by General Willcox.
It was a severe disappointment to be thus separated from the
brave men with whom we had shared a common danger and
won a common glory; but, as if to compensate us for this
trial, and to render the separation less painful, we were not
parted from our old, well-proved, and dearly beloved comrades,&mdash;the
Forty-fifth Pennsylvania. These two regiments,
the Forty-fifth and Thirty-sixth, henceforth to be more closely
attached, and more than ever brothers, were assigned to the
First Brigade, Second Division. Major-General John G.
Parke was announced as Division Commander and Brigadier-General
Robert B. Potter as Commander of the brigade,
consisting of the Forty-eighth and Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts, Seventh Rhode Island,
Fifty-first New York, and Fifty-eighth Massachusetts,&mdash;the
latter not yet reported,&mdash;six regiments, numbering, present
for duty, one hundred and seven officers, and two thousand
five hundred fifty-one enlisted men. With the exception of
the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts, all these regiments had served
long in the Ninth Corps, and had made enviable records. The
Fifty-first New York had been commanded by Generals Ferrero
and Potter as Colonels, and at Antietam Bridge, with
the Fifty-first Pennsylvania, had won a reputation for dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>tinguished
bravery and soldierly bearing second to none in
the army. Of our division and brigade commanders we were
justly proud. They had been identified with the corps during
its entire existence, and both had commanded the corps,
reflecting credit upon themselves, the corps, and the service.</p>

<p>At the date of the reorganization of the division both
Generals Parke and Potter were absent, on account of sickness;
and that portion of the order relating to commanders
in the Second Division was never carried into effect. Colonel
S. G. Griffin, Sixth New Hampshire Volunteers, commanding
the Second Brigade, was placed in temporary command
of the division, and Colonel Joshua K. Sigfried, of the Forty-eighth
Pennsylvania Volunteers, assumed command of our
brigade. Both these officers were able and distinguished
soldiers. Upon his return to duty, at the close of the month,
General Potter was placed permanently in command of the
division, and General Parke returned to duty to be assigned
as chief of the Ninth Corps staff.</p>

<p>Under date of April 21st, Surgeon James P. Prince was
assigned to duty as Chief Medical Officer of the Fourth
Division; Captain Raymond as Inspector of First Brigade,
Second Division, on the staff of General Potter; and Lieutenant
Emory as Assistant Commissary of the Fourth
Division. On the 23d of April, Captain S. C. Warriner,
Company E, and First Lieutenants Samuel A. Goodspeed
and John A. Rice, tendered their resignations, which were
accepted, and they left for Massachusetts, much to the
regret of their commands and their comrades in the regiment.</p>

<p>The work of reorganization went forward very rapidly.
Although the destination of the corps remained as great a
mystery as ever, it was evident that preparations for an
important movement were being perfected, and that we
might be ordered suddenly to leave. On the evening of the
22d the command was ordered to be in readiness to march, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
before daylight of the 23d the delightful camp was broken
up, and the corps took up its line of march, not toward the
harbor, but in the direction of Washington, following the
line of the Elk Ridge and Annapolis Railroad. After a march
of thirteen miles the corps bivouacked in the fields for the
night. Very early on the 24th the march was resumed. In
about six hours we reached the Baltimore and Washington
turnpike, and at nightfall the corps went into camp near
Bladensburg, distant about eight miles from the city of
Washington. At four o'clock on the morning of Monday,
the 25th, <em>reveillé</em> was sounded; but, owing to a severe shower,
the regiment did not march until about eight o'clock. When
the march was resumed the corps passed through Bladensburg
and continued in the direction of the city. We reached the
outskirts of the capital about noon, and halted on New
York avenue for the command to close up, as we were to pay
a marching salute to the President and General Burnside,
who were to review us from a balcony of Willard's Hotel.
It soon became known that the corps was to pass through
the city, and the streets along the line of march were densely
packed. The column was greeted with cheers and applause.
Many spirited descriptions of this imposing scene were
published at the time in the journals of the day; but none
is more graphic than the following, taken from a Memorial-Day
Address, at Beverly, Mass., by Honorable R. S. Rantoul,
May 30, 1871, seven years after the scene narrated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the 25th of April, 1864, I stood, at high noon, on a
thronged sidewalk of the city of Washington. Across the
street, and raised on a balcony above the surging crowd, a
lank, sad man stood gazing wistfully down&mdash;his head uncovered&mdash;upon
the passing scene beneath. An unutterable
sadness seemed to have fixed itself upon his face. For the
most part he was unnoticed by the long procession, which,
hour after hour, with frequent pauses, but with elastic tread,
pushed on through dust and sweat, for Long Bridge, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
rods off&mdash;then over the Potomac and into Virginia. In dull
succession, company on company, battalion by battalion,
brigade after brigade, wearily yet cheerfully, they tramped
on under that Southern sun, sometimes singing, oftener
thoughtful, never seemingly regretful. It was one of
those soft, vernal days, whose very air, as if breathed from
groves of oranges and myrtle, seemed able to melt all hearts.
Music there was; but strangely, as it seemed, not of that
martial strain, associated, in piping times of peace, with the
rush of battle. Exquisite music there was from martial
bands, but for the hour they seemed to have attuned themselves
to melodies of home and love. Shoulder to shoulder,
looking not back, asking not whither, marched the bronzed
veteran of East Tennessee and Carolina, with regiments of
raw recruits,&mdash;tradesmen and mechanics from the towns,
the farmer and frontiersman of the West, the lumberman
from his Eastern forest, Indian sharp-shooters attached to
Western infantry, favored sons of culture and wealth, the
first black division, five or six thousand strong, following
the white State flag of Massachusetts, batteries of artillery,
squadrons of cavalry; mingling with these or pressing hard
upon them, commissary wagons, ambulances, and quartermasters'
trains, stuffed with the equipage of hospital and
camp; and, last of all, as far as the eye could reach, fat
beeves choked up the dusty way. Solemnly the mighty
mass moved forward to confront its fate. Many a brave man
felt that day that he was crossing Long Bridge never to
return. Little heed paid they that the eye of Lincoln was
upon them; little ardor they caught from sad, sweet music
or the cheers and greetings of the thronging streets! Little
was there for them of pride, pomp, or circumstance of
glorious war! Grim resolve and cheerful devotion were the
lessons of the hour!</p>

<p>"Ask where you would, you got no clue to their destination,
for no one knew it! They had waited long at
Annapolis, expecting to be ordered off by sea. Not a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that day, of all those marching legions, knew whither he
was going!</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Theirs not to reason why!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Theirs but to do and die!'<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>"Only the lank, sad man, who gazed from his high place
upon them, hat in hand, as though with a friend's last look,
and the few high officials about him, knew more than that the
Ninth Army Corps, twenty-five thousand strong, had been
ordered from Annapolis to Alexandria! The veil of the
future was not yet lifted."</p></div>

<p>Chaplain Woodbury says, "It was a spectacle which made
many eyes grow moist and dim. And thus the corps that
had never lost a flag or a cannon marched through Washington.
Crossing Long Bridge the troops went into camp
about two miles from Alexandria."</p>

<p>Even then many of the men still cherished the hope that
transports would be in readiness for them at Alexandria.
But these notions were soon put to flight. To the corps was
assigned the duty of guarding the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad from the Potomac to the Rapidan; and reluctantly
the fond hopes of a coast expedition and an independent
movement were abandoned.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 27th, at ten o'clock A.M., the brigade
left Alexandria to follow the divisions which had been
advanced toward the Rappahannock, and after a fatiguing
march of sixteen miles encamped at night three miles beyond
Fairfax Court-House. The next day the march was continued
over the ground made historic in 1861, through Centreville,
and past the old earthworks at Manassas. At
noon we halted an hour for dinner on the Bull Run battle-field.
Afterwards we forded the Run, and at six o'clock,
having marched eighteen miles, went into camp at Bristow
Station, on the field where the Second Corps achieved a
brilliant victory the autumn before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>At six o'clock the next morning the brigade was in line,
but did not move out of camp until half-past nine; marched
then about half a mile, and countermarched, and marched
again, until finally, about three o'clock, we went into camp
near the railroad, on new ground, which was ordered to be laid
out according to army regulations. The corps was being
distributed along the line of the railroad in supporting distance,
and the progress was very slow.</p>

<p>On the 30th it became necessary to make another change,
and our "Regulation Camp" was abandoned to others. We
marched at half-past five o'clock in the morning, crossed
Kettle Run at noon, and relieved the Seventeenth Regular
Infantry, of the Fifth Corps, taking possession of the splendid
camp near Catlett's Station, which they had occupied
during the winter. Captain Morse, with Co. C, was sent forward
to Catlett's, to guard the station and water-tanks, while
the remainder of the regiment went into camp. The larger
portion of the regiment was accommodated in the barracks
of the Seventeenth Regulars, but the three left companies
were obliged to occupy their shelter-tents.</p>

<p>Upon reaching this place, it being the last day of the
month, the regular monthly return of the regiment was
made up and forwarded to head-quarters. As being the inventory
of the effective strength with which we entered the
campaign it may be interesting, for the purpose of comparison,
to include a synopsis of the report. At that date we had
present for duty fourteen commissioned officers, and four
hundred and twenty-six enlisted men, belonging to the regiment,
including ninety-one men transferred from the Twenty-ninth
Massachusetts Volunteers, or four hundred and forty
in all. In addition we had fifty-six effective men belonging
to the Forty-sixth New York, assigned for duty to our regiment,
making a total of four hundred and ninety-six, of whom
three hundred and thirty-five were members of the Thirty-sixth.
In addition there were forty-two enlisted men on
extra or daily duty, and thirteen sick in the hospital, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
a total present with the brigade of five hundred and fifty-one.
Three officers and eighty-five enlisted men were on
special duty with the corps, and five officers and two hundred
and ninety-two enlisted men were absent beyond the
limits of the department, making the whole number on the
regimental rolls, present and absent, twenty-two commissioned
officers, and nine hundred and fourteen enlisted
men.</p>

<p>The following officers were present for duty with the regiment:
Major Draper, Adjutant Hodgkins, Assistant Surgeon
Bryant, Quartermaster Tuttle, Captains Barker,
Smith, Buffum, Bailey, Morse, Holmes, and Ames; First
Lieutenants Daniels, Fairbank, Burrage, and Marshall, or
the average of but one commissioned officer for each company
in the line. Company I was commanded by Orderly
Sergeant Alonzo A. White, who had received a commission
as Second Lieutenant and was awaiting muster-in. Second
Lieutenants White, Hancock, Wright, and Davidson had
been unable to muster in the grade to which they had been
commissioned, their companies being below the minimum,
and had already, under date of April 26th, been recommended
for promotion to fill the vacancies caused by the
promotion of First Lieutenant Daniels (who was to succeed
Captain Warriner), and the resignations of Lieutenants
Cross, Goodspeed, and Rice. The following officers were
absent from the regiment: Lieutenant-Colonel Goodell, from
disability resulting from wounds; Surgeon Prince, Captain
Raymond, and Lieutenant Emory, on special duty with the
corps; Captain Smith, Lieutenants Davis and Brigham, on
special duty, recruiting; First Lieutenant Robinson, absent
by reason of wounds.</p>

<p>The Ninth Corps was now in position, scattered along the
line of railroad from Fairfax to the Rappahannock, and had
relieved all the troops of the Army of the Potomac which
were now concentrated near the Rapidan. The duty of
guarding the railroad was not arduous, but it required con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>stant
vigilance, and the troops were continually on the alert
lest a band of rebel guerillas which infested the region
should make a sudden dash, destroy a portion of the road,
and thereby seriously interrupt communication with the main
army, encamped near Brandy Station. To guard against an
incursion of this body, a strong picket force was stationed
along the railroad, and a portion of the troops in camp were
kept in readiness to repel an attack. The defences consisted
of a formidable abatis surrounding the entire camp. The
situation was very pleasant, and the daily duties and routine
of camp were performed. On the 2d of May a large
reconnoitring party was sent out, under command of Captain
Holmes; but no trace of an enemy could be discovered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

IN THE WILDERNESS.</h2>


<p>On the morning of the 4th all doubts as to our destination
or the length of our stay at this point were removed
by the receipt of an order from General Burnside for
the corps to concentrate, and move forward to the Rapidan.
At ten o'clock that forenoon the tents were struck, the line
was formed, and we left our pleasant camp, little realizing
the terrible scenes immediately awaiting us. In our march
we followed the line of the railroad, and were joined at
Catlett's Station by the command of Captain Morse. At
noon a halt was made at Warrenton Junction, where the
Second Division concentrated. Our brigade was now commanded
by Colonel Zenas R. Bliss, of the Seventh Rhode
Island, as Colonel Sigfried had been assigned to command a
brigade of the colored division. The march was continued
all the afternoon, and at nightfall we bivouacked at Bealeton
Station, having marched thirteen miles.</p>

<p>On that day we received information of the resignation of
our esteemed commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Goodell, in
consequence of the wound he received at Blue Springs.
His ability as a soldier and his reputation as a man were
well established in the corps, and recognized by its commander,
who desired him to remain in the service, and
requested the Secretary of War to assign him to special duty.
But the nature of his wound prevented him from rendering
active service in the field, as he desired, and he was compelled
reluctantly to resign.</p>

<p>At daylight of the 5th the command was in motion. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
nine o'clock we crossed the Rappahannock on a pontoon
bridge. Here we saw the monument of wood, bearing the
inscription, "Erected in memory of the brave sons of Maine
who fell while gallantly charging these heights, November 7th,
1863. Fifth, Sixth, and Twentieth Maine." The monument
bore the names of the fallen heroes, among which we
read the names of several members of the Twentieth,&mdash;our
fellow-voyagers of the "Merrimac" in 1862.</p>

<p>As soon as the division had crossed the river the march
was resumed over fields, through forests, and along dusty
roads. The halts became less frequent, and the steadily increasing
heat was severely felt. At noon we ate our dinner
amid deserted camps, which but a day or two before were
occupied by our comrades of the Army of the Potomac; and
we knew that the terrible struggles of the past were soon to
be renewed. Indeed, only an hour passed, and the deep
booming of artillery was heard beyond the Rapidan. The lagging
pace was now quickened, and dull hearts were stimulated
to fresh life and courage. "Grant has found his objective!"
"Hark! There it is again!" "They're at it, boys!" "Grant's
found the Johnnies!" "Go it! We'll be in to-night!"&mdash;these
and many like expressions were uttered by the men,
excited for a moment at the sound of battle; while the
clenched hands and compressed lips proved that the hour
of great endeavor&mdash;for victory or death&mdash;was near. No
lagging now; no more halting for rest; but on&mdash;forward!
The sounds of the battle grew louder and nearer, the din of
musketry mingling with the roar of artillery. As we neared
the conflict the spirits of the men seemed to grow lighter and
more elastic and buoyant. The speed, of the march was not
abated until the Rapidan, at Germanna Ford, was reached.
There, in the confusion of trains, artillery, and massing battalions,
we were allowed a moment's rest. The halt, however,
was brief. Soon the order&mdash;<em>Forward!</em> was given; and away
we marched over the pontoon bridge, which swayed beneath
our tread, with the sound of battle more appalling in front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and the apparent confusion more startling in rear. As we
crossed that sluggish stream, to many minds recurred the
well-known lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Part of the host have crossed the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And part are crossing now!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>The regiment was now south of the Rapidan; and, upon
halting, we had an opportunity of looking about, and many
and earnest inquiries were made of every one coming from
the front. We learned that the entire army had crossed the
river the day before,&mdash;the Fifth and Sixth Corps at Germanna
Ford; the Second Corps, and the immense supply
train of more than four thousand wagons, at Ely's Ford, six
miles below; and that the whole army had pushed southward
on the two available roads leading toward Spottsylvania,&mdash;Grant's
plan being to avoid the intrenchments of the enemy
behind the Rapidan, turn his right, and by a rapid movement
get between him and Richmond, and force him to retire, or
fight a decisive battle on open and more advantageous ground.</p>

<p>Lee, from his signal-stations, observed the movement,
offered no opposition to the passage of the river, but, instead
of falling back, put his columns in motion by two parallel
roads (the Orange and Fredericksburg Plank Road and
Turnpike), to strike the Army of the Potomac at right angles
with its line of advance, when it was well on its march
through the tangled Wilderness. He moved from his works
over roads and cart-tracks perfectly familiar to him, with the
intention of assailing Grant's flank, separating the several
corps, and then defeating them in detail.</p>

<p>The movement was a bold one, made with great celerity
and with Lee's entire army; and General Grant was forced to
accept battle in this unlooked-for place at the very commencement
of the campaign. He did not expect, or rather
did not desire, to be attacked in such a wilderness, and the
order of march for this day, if executed, would have carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
his army beyond the Wilderness into the open country around
Spottsylvania Court-House. But with characteristic promptness
and resolution Grant faced to meet the enemy; the lines
were pushed into the dense forests, and the terrible battle
which will live in history as the "Battle of the Wilderness"
now raged around us.</p>

<p>This region, known as the Wilderness, was densely covered
by a second growth of low, scraggy pines, scrub-oaks and
hazel,&mdash;a wild, uneven, tangled thicket, with but few openings
that would permit the use of artillery, or clearings for
formation and movement of troops. It is a region of gloom
and the shadow of death. The advantage of position was
entirely with the enemy, who were familiar with every ravine
and ridge and cow-path throughout the dense jungle.
Neither superiority of numbers nor the most skilful generalship
could counterbalance the great advantages of the enemy.
"In that horrid thicket lurked two immense armies, and
there came out of its depths the crackle and roll of musketry
like the noisy boiling of some hell-cauldron that told
the story of death."</p>

<p>General Burn side ordered the division forward. We
were worn and weary. Nearly twenty-five long miles lay
between us and our resting-place of last night. The march
had been severe and tedious, and yet with willing feet and
hopeful hearts we pushed on, feeling the magic influence of
that presence which, at Antietam, Campbell's Station, and
Knoxville, had inspired the heroism of the men of the Ninth
Corps. The march was continued for two miles over the
narrow, dusty road, now crowded with wagons, guns, and
troops; and just at dusk we filed to the right into the woods,
and, after receiving orders to be in constant readiness to
move, we stacked arms. Soon the groups gathered around
little fires, kindled marvellously quick, attested the sharp
appetites of the men. Although the march had been forced
and exhausting but very few of the men had fallen out.
Major Draper's quarters were established on the left flank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
very near the road, in order that there should be no delay in
finding him should the regiment be needed in the night.</p>

<p>The night was passed in a state of anxious suspense.
What a night! The continuous fire of the skirmishers
swelled now and then into a crashing volley which extended
along the lines, the shouts of teamsters urging on their
jaded beasts, the music of bands far in the rear, and the
tramp of passing troops,&mdash;all blended in one strange, discordant
strain. How many of our brave men sat by the
smouldering fires, thinking of the loved ones in homes they
should never enter again! How many lay down to catch
the last few hours' sleep left for them on earth before closing
their eyes in the sleep of death! Thus the few weary
hours of the night dragged on.</p>

<p>Between one and two o'clock we were aroused, and before
three o'clock we moved out quietly by the left. Marching
along the road in rear of the line of battle, at daybreak we
reached a clearing, within which was situated the Old Wilderness
Tavern. Here the brigade was halted, and ordered
to load and prepare for action.</p>

<p>The battle was renewed at quarter before five. Grant
had ordered an attack along the whole line to be delivered
at five o'clock. Lee anticipated him, and was fifteen minutes
earlier. The battle soon became general. Far on the left
was heard the terrific fire of Hancock's advancing line. On
the right Sedgwick was beating back the enemy's fierce
attack; while in our front the fire raged along the Fifth
Corps line. Being ordered forward, we continued our
march toward the left of the Fifth Corps line, over a road
leading in the direction of Parker's store, the Second Brigade
having the right of the column. After marching about half
a mile the men of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania were deployed
as skirmishers, to cover the flank of our brigade.
After moving about half a mile further a line of battle was
formed, and here the regiment breakfasted. The enemy's
skirmishers soon opened fire, but retired before General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Griffin's advance. In moving forward we crossed a small
stream called Wilderness Run, and continued to advance
until we encountered a brisk fire of artillery from a rebel
battery, and a sharp musketry fire at close range. The line
advanced to the edge of a small clearing, across which the
enemy was strongly posted with a battery. The Second
Brigade was warmly engaged, the action had become quite
brisk, and General Potter was making preparations to charge
the battery, when orders were received to withdraw, move
farther to the left, and attack on the right of General
Hancock's line, near the Plank Road, that portion of the line
being then hard pressed.</p>

<p>Hancock's attack had been very successful. He had
driven the enemy fully a mile and a half back on the trains,
artillery, and head-quarters of the Confederate Army, which
were in imminent danger of capture; but in the rapid advance
his line of battle had become so broken in the dense
forest as to require readjustment before he could press
forward and secure the prize almost within his grasp.
While this was being done the enemy was reinforced by
Longstreet's troops, who had been pushed forward rapidly to
the threatened point. When, therefore, Hancock's line advanced
to resume the attack he was confronted by a superior
force, and was not only unable to make any impression on
the enemy, but was in turn pressed back over all the ground
he had gained, and was himself now in need of assistance.</p>

<p>The story of the Battle of the Wilderness is one of the
most intensely interesting of the war; but it will be referred
to in this record only to describe intelligibly the action
taken by the regiment in its relation to the engagement as a
whole. We received the orders to retire about ten o'clock
in the forenoon, and moved by the left flank through the
dense forest and underbrush, which were almost impenetrable,
through swamps deep with water, back to the clearing, to
the assigned position, which was in rear of a gap said to exist
between the left of the Fifth Corps and the right of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Second. Our position was about a mile and a half in front
of the Old Wilderness Tavern, facing nearly south, and not
far from the Plank Road which runs south-east from Germanna
Ford. Our division was ordered to advance and fill
the gap, and to attack the enemy as soon as found. Each
regiment was to skirmish along its own front. On our right
was Wadsworth's division of the Fifth Corps, and it was
expected we would connect our left with Barlow's division
of the Second Corps. With a detail from each regiment,
Captain McKibben, of General Potter's staff, rode into the
woods to establish a skirmish line. He had not proceeded
far when he was fired upon by the enemy, and his horse was
killed.</p>

<p>It being evident that the enemy was in strong force along
our immediate front a general advance was ordered. The
regiments were ordered to advance as rapidly as possible,
keeping close connection on the right and left, and to attack
without delay. The Fifty-first New York was formed on our
left; the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania joined our right; beyond
this we could not see the brigade line and knew nothing of
its formation. A strong skirmish line was sent out from our
front, under Captain Bailey, of Company G, and when all was
in readiness the line of battle pushed forward into the dense
forest. The heat was intense; the men were almost exhausted
from their long march of the previous day, were famished and
weary; but the thought of the burden of battle borne thus
far by our brave comrades caused them to march with steady
tread as they moved onward toward the foe. In a few
moments the line received a tremendous volley, and the
advance was checked for an instant, but only long enough
for us to ascertain the exact position of the enemy and
strengthen the skirmish line. This being done, Captain
Bailey advanced very rapidly, driving the enemy's skirmishers
through a swampy ravine into his entrenchments. The
line of battle halted and closed up, while the Thirty-sixth
and Forty-fifth made nearly a half wheel to the right, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
order that our line might conform more nearly to the line of
the enemy, which, as far as we could determine, crossed our
line of battle diagonally.</p>

<p>During all this time the fire from the rebel line was very
sharp and close, but the casualties were few. The left flank
was found to be very much exposed, and the Fifty-first New
York was drawn back to cover the flank and rear, leaving the
Thirty-sixth on the extreme left of the division line of
battle.</p>

<p>In front of our line, across the swampy ravine, on the
crest of a wooded slope, were the breastworks of the enemy,
made of felled trees and brush and the bodies of their dead.
Behind these rude intrenchments stood Anderson's brigade,
Field's division (Hood's old division) of Longstreet's
veteran corps. It was composed of troops from South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Texas. Surely they were
no mean foe. At Antietam Bridge, on the Heights of
Fredericksburg, at Campbell's Station, and in the defences
of Knoxville, the Ninth Corps had engaged with them in
deadly conflict, and knew full well the devotion of these men
to their cause, and the desperate valor with which they
would defend their works. Once more these old antagonists
stood face to face, about to renew the fearful struggle of other
days on bloody fields. The foeman was worthy of our steel.
The order, "Forward, double quick!" was shouted, and with
loud and ringing cheers our lines advanced. The enemy
poured in terrific volleys; their bullets whistled around us and
thinned our ranks; but the advance was not checked. The
left of our regiment first struck the rebel line, and received
the severest fire, but pressed on through it, and the Thirty-sixth
and Forty-fifth broke the line, went over the breastworks
with a rush, and drove out the enemy in our front.
The attack had been most determined and successful, and the
regiment had complete possession of the rebel works in its
front. Thus far all had gone well. The Fifty-first New
York, however, had broken in the attack and failed to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the line with which it was confronted, and, in a brief time,
though to us it seemed an age, the enemy rallied, moved
upon our left flank, swept round toward our rear, and we
were subjected to a fearful fire of musketry at short range.
Having no supports, and being outflanked and overpowered
on the left, that portion of the line was unable to hold the
position, and began to retire in some confusion. The position
was too valuable to abandon without a desperate struggle,
and Major Draper leaped upon the log breastworks in the
centre, and endeavored by words and motions to turn back
the left wing, in order to present a front to the enemy attacking
on that flank. Captain Barker, in command of the left
wing, vainly endeavored to persuade a regiment of the Third
Division sent forward to support the attack, to swing to the
left and attack the enemy. In the most critical moment of
the fight, while gallantly rallying the line, Major Draper was
shot through the shoulder and carried senseless from the
field.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The regiment was loth to give up the great advantage
it had gained, and the fighting was hand to hand,&mdash;terrible
and bloody. The men fought gallantly; but the force upon
our left was too strong, and our line was compelled to retire.
Falling back slowly, with their faces toward the enemy, the
regiment preserved a good line, returning the enemy's fire,
and retired but a short distance. Sergeant Henry Todd, who
bore the State color, although wounded in the arm, refused
to the last to fall back, and received a bullet in the head,
which laid him low in death. The flag was seized from his
dying grasp by Corporal Michael Long, of Company A, who
himself was wounded a moment later, and before it reached
the ground was seized by Sergeant Gilbert Rawson, who
bore it through the battle, and the subsequent campaign.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Sergeant Kimball, of Company F, saved Major Draper's life during the battle. One
of the enemy, a soldier of the South Carolina Rifles, was lying behind a log, and had
deliberate aim on Major Draper, who was standing exposed to his fire, and was in the
act of firing when Sergeant Kimball struck up the musket with his own, and the ball
passed through the Major's hat. Soon after this Major Draper received a wound from
a rebel sharp-shooter.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>In the midst of this terrific fight Colonel Curtin, of the
Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, assumed command of the brigade.
Hartranft, with his brigade of the Third Division, came up at
the same moment, when the whole line advanced in the face
of a furious fire; and although the enemy was severely handled,
and his line forced at several points, yet the opposition
was so determined as to prevent complete success. Through
all these trying scenes the regiment behaved with great gallantry,
and held its position to the last moment. The brigade
now retired a short distance, re-formed, and corrected the line.
Here Lieutenant Marshall, of Company A, was badly wounded
and carried to the rear. During this temporary lull, amid the
cries of the wounded, and the burning undergrowth that
added horror to the scene, our comrades of the Forty-fifth
struck up the chorus: "We'll rally round the flag, boys,
rally once again." The Thirty-sixth took up the strain, and
made those smoking woods ring with the chorus and cheers
of the undaunted men.</p>

<p>During the afternoon new dispositions were made for a third
attack. As our ammunition was exhausted we were relieved
in the front line by the Third Division, and closely supported
its attack, which was made with great vigor soon after five
o'clock. The charge was gallant and determined, and they
who heard that terrific musketry will never forget it. The
enemy's skirmish line was driven in, and their main line of
battle, which had come out of the works, was broken and
forced back. A portion of the line on the left was again carried,
but it could not be held. The enemy's fire was of the
heaviest; but the main line held the ground up to the teeth
of the enemy until dusk, when our division took position to
the right of the Third Division in the front line, within close
musket range of the enemy. A strong skirmish line was deployed,
and the regiment intrenched.</p>

<p>While these changes of position were being made it became
necessary to leave many of our wounded between the opposing
lines, and volunteers were called for to go out under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
enemy's fire, and bring in such as could be removed. Several
gallant men of the Thirty-sixth offered to perform this perilous
service. While thus employed, Corporal George E. Nourse,
of Company I, was struck by the fatal bullet of a sharp-shooter,
and was himself borne away upon the stretcher with which he
had assisted to carry others to the rear. He was buried near
the spot where he fell, and sleeps, like many of his comrades,
in that far-off grave in the lonely Wilderness, or in the National
Cemetery at Fredericksburg, where so many of our comrades
buried on the Wilderness battle-ground have since been laid
to rest.</p>

<p>Thus closed in blood and gloom the second day of the sanguinary
battle of the Wilderness. When darkness settled on
those smouldering forests the roll-call bore witness to the
sacrifice we had offered that day on the altar of Freedom.
Eighty-five were absent. Of this number, twelve were known
to have been killed, fifty-three wounded, and of the twelve
reported "missing in action" several were supposed to have
been killed or wounded, and consumed in the burning of the
underbrush between the contending lines. The brigade lost
five hundred and four in killed, wounded, and missing; the
heavy loss of the Thirty-sixth being occasioned by our great
exposure, and the severe fire on our left flank and rear. The
scenes and events of the day were recounted, and entrusted
to the keeping of faithful memories. Sergeant Rawson had
his story to tell of the coolness and thoughtfulness of Color-Sergeant
Todd. As they were about to enter the battle he
said to Rawson, "If anything happens to me, take good care
of the State color." But for this timely charge the flag might
have fallen into the enemy's hands, for Rawson, deeply impressed
with the words of his friend, was near him when he
fell, ready to take the flag from Todd's dying grasp.</p>

<p>In the line the severest loss was sustained by Company I,
commanded by Orderly Sergeant White, losing three killed
and ten wounded (three of them mortally) out of thirty-five
taken into action.</p>

<p>With the first ray of daylight on the 7th the men were
astir, in expectation of orders for a general advance. The
skirmishers exchanged a few shots with the enemy at daybreak,
but neither party manifested any disposition to attack.
The firing along Hancock's front, on our left, was very severe
at times, and word was passed down the lines that his corps
was to make an attack at right angles with our front; but the
morning wore away and no attack was made. A death-like
quiet pervaded our lines. The silence of the enemy was considered
ominous, and the picket force under Captain Morse
was doubled, and then cautiously advanced toward the
enemy's skirmish pits, but only to find them deserted. The
enemy had withdrawn.</p>

<p>Small parties were now sent out to remove the wounded
lying in our front, and to recover the bodies of the dead. As
the sad procession moved to the rear the hearts of many
were made sad in recognizing among the mangled dead and
wounded the forms of dear comrades whom we fondly hoped
had met the less sad fate of capture. The dead were carefully
buried, and their graves marked. While this sad work
was being performed the regiment erected a strong breastwork
of logs, and every precaution was taken to guard against
a sudden attack of the enemy. Here we were visited by
Colonel Morrison, of the Seventy-ninth New York,&mdash;our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
former brigade commander,&mdash;who was about to be mustered
out of the service, the term of his regiment having expired.
He had been wounded in the arm the day before, but refused
to go to the rear. He came over to say good-by to his
former "pets" before leaving for his home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

AT SPOTTSYLVANIA.</h2>


<p>Toward noon it became evident that a new movement
was contemplated. About one o'clock we marched by the
flank to the rear, and halted near the road for the rest of the
brigade to withdraw, and concentrate. We then moved
rapidly to the open ground near the Old Wilderness Tavern,
where the Ninth Corps was massed. There we saw our immense
artillery and ammunition trains moving in the direction
of Chancellorsville.</p>

<p>We remained at the tavern until dark, and had supper
there. For forty-eight hours our only food had been bread
and water. As soon as the trains were on the road we were
ordered to follow them in the direction of Chancellorsville.
The march was very tedious and vexatious, owing to the
darkness and the slow movement of the wagons. At every
few rods we were obliged to halt, and the weary men threw
themselves upon the ground for a few moments' rest, only to
be aroused to move a little distance and repeat the same experience.
At ten o'clock the picket-firing ceased, and we lay
down by the roadside for the night. At daylight we resumed
the march. At nine o'clock we reached Chancellorsville, and
halted in an open field, at the intersection of the Gordonsville
Plank and Orange County roads. Here stood the ruins of
the house used by General Hooker as head-quarters during
the great battle fought one year before, and all around us
traces of the bloody struggle could be seen. Without shelter
from the scorching sun, and covered with dust raised in great
clouds by the passing trains and troops, we remained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Chancellorsville during the entire day. The Fifth and Second
Corps had moved on the Brock road toward Spottsylvania;
the Sixth was with us. As the last division filed past us
down the Plank road, and the fire of the Wilderness died
away, the distant booming of artillery in our front announced
that the enemy was in position across the advance of the Fifth
Corps.</p>

<p>The firing increased all the afternoon, and at sunset was
very heavy. The brigade bivouacked at Chancellorsville,
and remained until nearly noon of the next day, when orders
were received to move down the Plank road in the direction
of the conflict. During the afternoon we moved from one
position to another, and at dusk were put in line of battle
upon a high crest west of the Richmond and Potomac
Railroad, on the extreme left of the army. We were not
permitted to remain long in this fine position, where we expected
to pass the night, but were moved out to the road
again, and marched rapidly through deserted camps and past
smouldering camp-fires, until late at night we bivouacked near
General Burnside's head-quarters, and upon the left of the
army of the Potomac, which during the day had been closing
around the strong position of the enemy at Spottsylvania
Court-House. Three divisions of our corps were now concentrated
at this point, the Fourth Division being detailed as
guard for the supply train of the army.</p>

<p>The 10th of May was clear and intensely hot. The burning
sun drove us from the open fields to seek the shelter of
the woods. There we lay during the long and tedious
hours, listening to the sounds of battle on our right, with
orders to be ready to move at a moment's notice. Thus
far during the campaign but little artillery had been used,
owing to the nature of the country; but on this day the
action was on more open ground, and much of the artillery
of both armies was brought into use, the cannonading resembling
one continuous peal of thunder.</p>

<p>Reports came to us that Lee's army was being forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
from its strong defences; in fact, rumors of the wildest
description reached us. They were soon to be dispelled,
however, for, at four o'clock, marching orders were received,
and in another moment we were on the road, marching in
the direction of the conflict. The route lay over a good
road, through noble forests, until at length we reached the
open country along the banks of the Ny river. After halting
at the Harris house for the command to close up, the march
was continued to the river, which we crossed by the turnpike
bridge. Here we filed to the left into an open field,
and the division was formed in line of battle, and ordered
to advance rapidly. On reaching a rise of ground in our
front we received a severe fire from the enemy's artillery;
but the advance was not checked. The troops on the right
of the road soon encountered the skirmishers of A. P. Hill's
corps, and pressed them back, our regiment threatening
their flanks. The artillery was now brought to bear on the
enemy's line, and the whole division advanced gallantly in
face of a heavy fire, and continued until darkness compelled
a halt. This movement was made in support of the famous
charge of twelve picked regiments of the Sixth Corps, upon
the right centre of the enemy's position. The assault was
made with great gallantry, and the works were carried with
a loss to the enemy of six cannon and nine hundred prisoners;
but the rebels were strongly reinforced, and the great
advantage which was gained could not be secured. At
nightfall the remnant of the noble column returned, leaving
their dead and wounded and the six pieces of cannon, which
could not be removed, in the enemy's hands.</p>

<p>The division passed the night in line of battle, without
fires or coffee. The picket line was attacked several times;
but no serious demonstration was made, and there were no
casualties on our front. At daylight of the 11th the
line advanced to the crest of a ridge directly in our front,
from which we obtained a fine view of the enemy's position.
We were about a quarter of a mile from the Court-House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
around which stood the enemy's earthworks, bristling with
cannon, and surrounded by a formidable abatis and slashing
of timber. They seemed to be alive with troops, who,
doubtless from our close advance, expected an immediate
attack. The enemy evidently desired our approach, and
were ready to give us a hot reception. The position was
strong naturally, and the fortifications and obstructions rendered
it well-nigh impregnable. Our pickets held a very
advanced position and kept up a lively skirmishing all the
morning. Being seriously exposed, we were ordered to
build a line of breastworks along our whole front, maintaining
at the same time the utmost vigilance lest the enemy
should attack our left and flank. Notwithstanding a close
and annoying fire we were able to construct a strong line
of intrenchments during the forenoon; but we were not
allowed the privilege of defending them, for at three o'clock
orders were received to withdraw with the utmost speed and
caution. This was a perilous undertaking in the face of a
watchful and powerful enemy. The movement was made
against the earnest remonstrance of the corps commander,
and the mistake was afterwards seen when too late to be
corrected. The day had been intensely hot, and now the
sky was black with clouds. As the movement commenced
the rain began to fall. Soon it descended in torrents, and
during the drenching rain which followed, the works were
evacuated without exciting the attention of the enemy.</p>

<p>The brigade was now hurried to the rear, the direction of
the march being toward the right of our line, and in another
hour the corps was massed in a large open field near the
Harris house. Here we remained more than an hour, exposed
to the full fury of the drenching rain, which caused
the men to shiver with cold. It was the first rain that had
fallen during the campaign, and, however welcome it might
have been in allaying the stifling dust and cooling the heated
air, it was decidedly unpleasant to be obliged to encounter
its full force in the open field, without shelter of any kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Here the wearied men partook of the first nourishment
during the day. At dusk the corps was again ordered forward
to a new position in the advanced line, more to the
right of that occupied during the day. We crossed the
broad meadows bordering the Ny river, and as we moved
forward an aid reported to Captain Barker that, Colonel
Bliss having been injured, he had been directed to notify
the senior officer to take command of the brigade, and that
Lieutenant-Colonel Pleasants, of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania,
was in command. He was soon succeeded, however,
by Colonel Curtin, who had been temporarily absent.</p>

<p>The shower settled into a steady rain, and the night
was cold and cheerless. The advance was continued in the
darkness until we reached a line of breastworks around a
deserted farm-house. Here we remained during the night.
The head-quarters of the regiment were in a dilapidated
barn, and nearly all the officers lay down upon the wet
ground, which constituted the floor. The place was filthy
and disagreeable; but any shelter was welcome on such a
night. The hours dragged drearily. The men were under
arms, and the pickets, though almost exhausted, were alert
and vigilant. We were ignorant of the enemy's position,
yet conscious that the morning light would reveal it, and be
the signal for a determined assault.</p>

<p>The morning of Thursday (the 12th) dawned cold and
dismal. A curtain of gray mist enshrouded the earth as
with a pall. The men shivered as they awoke from unrefreshing
sleep, and the order to advance was promptly responded
to. Without food we moved forward, continuing
the line of advance of the previous evening, and, after a short
march, reached a large opening in the forest, where a portion
of the corps was being massed in column by brigades in line
of battle. During the night the Second Corps had been
massed on our right, and were ordered to assault at daylight,
with a portion of our corps to support the left. We were
to advance by brigade front, formed <i lang="fr">en echelon</i>. The Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Brigade was in front, the First Brigade had the second line,
with the Thirty-sixth again on the extreme left. The
Second Brigade was ordered to advance to the right, to
uncover the front of our brigade, when we were to advance
rapidly to the front, connect our right with the left of
the Second Brigade, and push forward. While forming for
the attack we heard the loud cheers of the troops on our
right, who were charging the enemy, followed by the
thunder of artillery. This was the signal for our attack,
and the division advanced rapidly toward the woods, the
brigades deployed to the right and left, and a heavy skirmish
line was thrown out. We drew the first fire from the rebel
skirmishers at half-past four o'clock.</p>

<p>The line of our advance to the woods lay over a steep
knoll, which descended into a swampy thicket just in front
of the woods, and while crossing this exposed ground the
regiment encountered a very severe fire of musketry at short
range from the enemy posted in the edge of the woods; but
he retired rapidly before our advance, and, as we entered the
woods, attempted to swing around our left, with the evident
intention of outflanking us. To prevent this movement
Companies C, B, and K were deployed to the left of the
line of battle, to cover the flank and protect the rear. The
division which had been expected to prolong the line of
battle on the left had not come into position, and it seemed
to us that the dire experience of the Wilderness was now to
be repeated. But the enemy suddenly fell back, and appeared
to abandon the attempt to double our left flank. By
five o'clock the engagement had become very hot, and as the
division advanced the cheering on the right was renewed,
and the firing became terrific. The lurid flash of musketry
lighted up the dim woods, and the din of battle resounded
on every side.</p>

<p>Connection was established with Griffin's brigade, which
joined the left of the Second Corps near their point of attack
at the famous "death angle," thereby securing our right; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the left was badly exposed, and the advance of the promised
support in that direction was anxiously awaited. We were
in a dense forest, and it was impossible to distinguish the
position of the enemy or his approach, should he attack, until
the skirmishers should come in contact. The firing in
our immediate front was very sharp and close, indicating
the presence of a large force, and our skirmish line was
reinforced preparatory to a charge which we had been
ordered to make, and also to resist any attack of the
enemy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes intelligence was passed along the line that
Hancock had just finished a successful charge on the right,
carrying the enemy's line, near the McCool House, capturing
four thousand prisoners and twenty cannon. Soon after, a
large force of the enemy was discovered moving from the
right toward the left, in column, across our front. The
skirmishers opened a sharp fire, which was not returned,
but instead we heard the cry, "For God's sake, don't fire!"
At the same time word came from the right of our division,
"Cease firing! Hancock's prisoners are passing along your
front." The firing ceased, when in a few minutes a horrible
cry came from the left of the Thirty-sixth,&mdash;"The rebels are
on our flank!" The fatal impression seemed to prevail that
this body of the enemy was the division just captured by
General Hancock. A sergeant came in from the skirmish
line and reported that a Union officer had ordered the line to
cease firing, and that the rebels carried a white flag; and the
impression was general that these were rebel prisoners moving
toward the rear. They were formed squarely across
our flank, and Captain Buffum, Acting Major, who had command
of the left wing, walked out on the narrow wagon-track
which diagonally crossed our left, across which these rebels
had formed, and waving his sword toward them, cried out,
"Come in, Johnnies! We won't hurt you. Come in!" We
could look into their very faces. We could almost see the
whites of their eyes. They were the veterans of A. P. Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Lane's brigade,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of Heth's division. As far as we could distinguish
weapons they were standing at ordered arms. Captain
Buffum was but ten yards from them, and going toward
their line, when he was answered by a murderous volley,
which will never be forgotten by any who survived it. And
never shall we forget the splendid coolness and courage of
Captain Buffum as he came back to the line, and amid the
confusion which followed this terrible attack, calmly faced
two or three companies to the left, and gave the order,&mdash;"Let
them have it!" Though suffering fearfully the regiment
behaved nobly. The attack was terrific. It was the
most awful moment of our history. Yet the regiment was
equal to the emergency, and its stand, it is believed, saved
the division from panic or capture. The left was gradually
drawn back from the colors, and soon the entire left wing
presented a front to the enemy. Lying upon the ground,
loading and firing rapidly, pouring upon the enemy a low
fire which was most effective and deadly, they maintained the
unequal contest until an order came down from the right for
the whole line to charge. Then, rising to their feet in the
midst of the awful fire, with an alacrity and courage beyond
this feeble praise, the regiment was rushing toward the
enemy, when loud cheers were heard upon our left, and in
another moment we were joined by the gallant Twenty-first
Massachusetts,&mdash;the right regiment of the First Division line,&mdash;which
came up on the double quick to prolong the line of
battle. Cheer answered cheer, and both regiments charged
the enemy, who was driven back to his intrenchments with
great loss, leaving his killed and wounded in our possession.
Two lines of detached rifle-pits were taken, with some
prisoners, and the right brigade carried a portion of the
enemy's main line and captured two pieces of artillery; but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>a little while the enemy made a most furious attack, and the
connection with the Second Corps on the right was broken;
the right was turned and forced out of the works.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Lane's brigade was composed of the Seventh, Eighteenth, Twenty-eighth,
Thirty-third, and Thirty-seventh regiments of North Carolina troops. The operations
of the brigade on the morning of the 12th are detailed in the "History of
Lane's North Carolina Brigade," Southern Historical Society Papers, Vol. IX.,
No. 4, pp. 146, <i lang="la">et seq.</i></p></div>

<p>Soon after, a general attack along the whole line was
ordered, and the regiment advanced; but the enemy's works
at this point were too strong to be carried. The rebels made
several attempts to regain the ground we had occupied, but
were driven back each time with severe loss. Several times
orders were given from the right or left to attack, but the
assaults were successful only at isolated points. Along the
Third Division front the fighting was unusually desperate and
bloody. Charges and counter-charges were made and repulsed.
In the "death angle" on the right of our division
the fighting was the most sanguinary of the war. The enemy
made the most desperate attempts to recover the works, but
every attack was repulsed with great slaughter. About
noon we strengthened our skirmish line, which was very close
to the enemy's position, and a temporary line of rifle-pits
was thrown up, which afforded partial shelter. Slowly the
terrible day of Spottsylvania dragged on. The mist of the
morning was but the prelude to a heavy storm; at times
the rain fell in torrents.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the attack had somewhat subsided
a spirit of deep sadness pervaded the regiment. Comrades
and friends had been stricken in death. Those dismal woods
had been the scene of their last conflict; and many a companion
of weary marches and lonely picket, many a tried
and trusted comrade, was sleeping in death. Of the commissioned
officers, Captain Bailey, the beloved commander of
Co. G, had received a mortal wound. Corporal Hall, of his
company, was one of the first to fall in our close conflict with
the enemy, when we received the volley with which the battle
for us opened, and some of his comrades carried him a few
steps to the rear of our line of battle. Captain Bailey moved
at once to the spot, and as he was bending over the dying
corporal, a minie ball entered the captain's forehead, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
fell forward upon the corporal's body. Some of his men
carried him to the field hospital; but nothing could be done
for him. He breathed all day; but consciousness did not return,
and at nightfall he died. And so we were called to part
with a faithful officer and a noble-hearted companion. He
had entered the service with a patriotic desire to serve his
country; and his last words to those whom he loved, written
after the battle of the Wilderness, showed that he had
counted the cost, and was willing, if need be, to lay down his
life in the endeavor to secure the great objects for which on
our part the war was waged.</p>

<p>Captain Morse, of Company C, and Orderly Sergeant White,
commanding Company I, had both been badly wounded, and
taken to the rear. The loss of the regiment in its non-commissioned
officers was especially severe. They were rising
steadily from the ranks to fill the vacancies in the line to
which their bravery and capacity entitled them. These men
had conferred honor upon the regiment, and many of them
had won the highest respect and affection of their commanding
officers. Under any circumstances their loss to the
regiment would have been deplorable; at such a time it
seemed to us irreparable. The day had been to the regiment
a literal baptism of fire and blood; but before its close we
were destined to sustain another severe loss in the death
of First Lieutenant Henry W. Daniels, commanding Company
H. He had been in command of the skirmish line all
day, and toward evening came in to report the condition of
the line, get ammunition and receive instructions for the night.
He said he had fired considerably during the day and had
attracted the attention of the enemy. He left us with the
repeated caution from Captain Barker not to expose himself
unnecessarily. He had been at his post but a little while when
Sergeant Woodward, who was standing in the main line, saw
him fall, and cried out, "My God! the lieutenant is shot!"
His head was pierced by a minie ball, and he who but a few
moments before had left us in the full strength and courage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
early manhood was brought back a corpse. Comrade Bartlett,
who was on the skirmish line, thus relates the circumstances
of his death: "I was on the line about two rods
distant from him. He had just come out with ammunition
for us. A rebel sharp-shooter in a tree on our right had
troubled us exceedingly. Lieutenant Daniels took a musket
to bring him down, as he could see by the smoke when he
fired about where he was. After discharging the piece without
effect, he had reloaded and raised it to his shoulder to
fire the second time when he was shot by the sharp-shooter,
and fell dead." This event was a sad ending of a terrible
day, and cast a gloom upon all. We were pained at the
recollection that the last days of his life were saddened by
the death of his brother Myron in the Wilderness, only six
days before, and our hearts went out in sympathy toward the
kindred of all our slain in northern homes; and, as we
thought of the many scenes of peril through which we must
pass, and the certainty of death which awaited many, we
cried, in the anguish and bitterness of heart, "How long,
O Lord, how long?"</p>

<p>The loss in the regiment in this action, including the
Twenty-ninth men, was, killed, twenty-seven; wounded,

the hand, and in going to the rear, as he supposed, was captured. He was in several
rebel prisons, and was in Andersonville while Sherman was on his "March to the
Sea." While being removed from Andersonville, he with five or six others jumped
from the railroad train and escaped to the swamps, where they remained for several
weeks subsisting on roots and berries, and were on the verge of starvation, when they
found a <em>dug-out</em>, and made their way down the Altamaha river to the blockading
squadron, and were taken on board one of the vessels about six weeks after their escape.</p></div>

which lost seven killed and nine wounded,&mdash;a total of

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> In this action Captain Buffum acted as Major, and his Company [D] was commanded
by Sergeant Brooks until he was killed. The company was then under
command of Sergeant Liberty W. Foskett, until the arrival of First Sergeant John
A. Stearns, from recruiting service, May 15th. Sergeant Foskett was wounded at
Petersburg, June 17th, 1864.</p></div>

<p>During the entire night of the 12th the men were hard at
work felling trees and erecting breastworks, and by daylight
we had a strong defensive line. The 13th passed without
special incident. The skirmish-firing was sharp and unremitting,
and one man, Private William H. Doyle, Company
B, was badly wounded. A feeling of dread uncertainty
pervaded the troops. An assault upon the enemy's works
was ordered, but before any movement could be made the
order was countermanded. At times the rain fell in torrents,
and our position was very uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th the men belonging to the Twenty-ninth Massachusetts,
whose term of service expired that day, were sent
to the rear to be transported to Washington for muster-out.
They were followed, on the 16th, by the remainder of that
regiment, seventy-six in number, whose terms of service
expired at various dates between the 14th and 21st of May.
Immediately after the action of the 12th the attention of
General Burnside was called to the circumstances of the case,
and he at once ordered that the survivors should now have
their discharge, and caused them to be sent to Washington.
The departure of these comrades caused a material reduction
of our effective strength; but we rejoiced in their good
fortune, and bade them God-speed homeward. We regarded
them as brothers, and parted from them with deep regret.
They were transferred to our regiment on the 30th of January,
1864, while in Tennessee, under circumstances of peculiar
hardship, owing to what has always been considered a too
literal interpretation of a general order. For more than three
months they had been identified with our command in all
the hardships and privations of the spring of 1864. They
evinced the spirit of true Massachusetts soldiers, and nobly
performed their duty to the last hour of their service. Their
courage and devotion at Spottsylvania are worthy of the highest
praise. Eight of these men, Sergeants Mosher and Hamer,
Privates Mansfield, Alexander, Fisher, Ward, Morton, and
Murphy, having but a few, some of them only two, days
longer to serve to complete the honorable record of three years'
service, went into that battle and sealed their devotion by pouring
out their blood and dying in defence of the nation's honor.
To us it seemed hard, indeed, that these men could not have
been sent to the rear on the morning of that day, or assigned
to some duty whereby that sacrifice need not have been extorted.
But, like good soldiers, they went forward as ever
under the folds of the flag that before nightfall was to be
crimsoned with their blood. All honor to the noble band, also,
twelve in number, who were wounded on that day; and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
honor to the gallant regiment in which they were trained to
such performance of duty!</p>

<p>The storm continued throughout the 14th. In the night
the enemy drove in our pickets three times, and the men
were under arms, hoping that the enemy would attack the
main line. This, however, they declined to do. Sunday,
the 15th, was stormy and dismal. The long rain rendered
our position very trying and uncomfortable. We had but
little shelter, and the exposure to the constant bad weather,
the scarcity of food, the want of sleep, and the mental strain,
now began to have perceptible effect. Many cases of sickness
were reported, and Assistant-Surgeon Bryant, the only
medical officer with the regiment, afforded what relief the
limited means at hand would permit. The supply of ammunition
was replenished, and the lines were thoroughly inspected
by General Potter, who ordered a traverse built in
rear of our regiment. Although the weather was dark and
gloomy, and there were many discouraging circumstances,
the day was rendered comparatively happy by the arrival of
Captain Smith, First Lieutenant Brigham, and nine non-commissioned
officers, who had been absent since February on
recruiting service in Massachusetts. They received a soldier's
welcome, and proved to be a timely and valuable reinforcement.</p>

<p>On the 16th Captain Buffum, in charge of the skirmish
line, advanced the pickets, and strengthened and improved
the front line. This was not agreeable to the enemy, who
made several ineffectual attempts to force us back. A strong
demonstration was made on our part, and the firing was
severe. The enemy was found to be in full force, and no
attack was made. Cannonading and skirmishing continued
through the 17th, and the position of some of the corps was
changed. The Fifth and Sixth Corps moved to the left,
leaving only Birney's division of the Second Corps on the
right of the Ninth. Corporal Marcus Keep, of Co. E, was
mortally wounded. During the night it became evident that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a new movement was on foot. Troops were in line of battle
in our rear, and we were ordered to be in readiness to move
in any direction at a moment's notice. At four o'clock, on
the morning of the 18th, the artillery opened along the entire
line, under cover of which a portion of the Second Corps,
with the Second Brigade of our division, made a vigorous
attack upon the enemy's line. The enemy had slashed
timber along his front, and the abatis was almost impenetrable,
and by eleven o'clock, after three attempts to storm the
works, the effort was abandoned, although considerable ground
was gained, and a good position secured. The enemy's
artillery fire was very severe, and directed especially against
our division; but the loss in our brigade was very slight.
Toward evening the attacking column was withdrawn, and
the Second Brigade was massed in our rear.</p>

<p>The newly commissioned chaplain, Rev. Nathaniel Richardson,
reported on the 18th, and was assigned to duty in
the Field Hospital, among the sick and wounded.</p>

<p>At midnight the regiment was aroused by an aide-de-camp,
and ordered to move silently and rapidly to the rear. Upon
reaching the open ground, where we formed on the morning
of the 12th, we filed toward the left of the line, and after a
very tedious march, over rough corduroy, stumps, and fallen
timber, halted at daylight near the Anderson house, where
a large portion of the army was massed. At eight o'clock
the corps marched by the flank toward the left, in a southerly
direction, and while on the march were passed by
Generals Grant, Meade, and Burnside, who were greeted
with loud cheering. It soon became evident that a general
movement was in progress. After marching three or four
miles a halt was ordered, and the division filed into a large
open field, and went into line of battle on the left of the
corps; afterwards the division was faced to the left, and
formed in two lines of battle, the First Brigade in front.
The brigade was then formed in column by regiments, the
Thirty-sixth being in front, and moved forward across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
field to the edge of a forest, where companies A and G
were deployed as skirmishers under the eye of General
Potter. We moved through a belt of fine woods, and halted
in front of a broad, open plain, at a point where three roads
intersected. Here we were ordered to intrench. A high
rail fence formed the basis of the line, and in a little while
we had a strong defence. Jones' Eleventh Massachusetts
Battery was put in position on our left, and by noon the line
was firmly established, and the men lay down to enjoy the
much-needed rest.</p>

<p>That afternoon we received the first mail since leaving
Catlett's, fifteen days before; and many hearts were made
happy by loving words from home. The dangers and
fatigues of the past two weeks were soon forgotten or transcribed
to paper, for we now had our first opportunity for
writing as well as receiving letters. Scattered through the
woods in all directions could be seen the brave soldiers, who
but yesterday were engaged in deadly conflict, recounting to
the loved ones at home the story of the marches, bloody
battles, and sad losses of the past two weeks. Ours was,
proverbially, a "letter-writing" regiment, and the mail for
our single regiment often exceeded that of the remainder of
the brigade.</p>

<p>The camp at this place was greatly enjoyed. Baggage
was brought up from the rear, shelter tents were pitched,
and the men improved all the opportunities for rest. A
strong force reconnoitred toward Stannard's Mills, on the
Po river, and returned safely, having found no enemy within
five miles of our position. Heavy firing continued on our
right, and an attempt of Early's corps to turn the right flank,
and seize the Fredericksburg road, was splendidly repulsed
by a division of heavy artillery regiments on their way to
the front to reinforce the army.</p>

<p>But, like all other pleasant experiences in a soldier's life,
this rest was soon to end. At half-past three o'clock, on the
afternoon of the 21st, we received orders to break camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and the brigade, with Jones' battery, was ordered to take
possession of the crossing of the Po river at Stannard's Mills.
After marching about five miles the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
which was in the advance, encountered the enemy's pickets,
and after a lively fight drove them across the river. Upon
our further advance we uncovered a battery of three guns,
posted near the river, which opened upon us with a heavy fire
of shell and canister. Colonel Curtin formed his line of
battle in the woods near the river, and the skirmishers
became briskly engaged along the river's banks. General
Potter came up at this time to examine the position of the
enemy, which was found to be strongly intrenched. While
searching for a ford by which to cross and attack, orders
were received to suspend the attack, and our brigade and
Jones' battery were left in position, to prevent the enemy
from crossing, while the remainder of the column moved, by
way of Smith's Mills, to Downer's bridge.</p>

<p>The day had been pleasant and very hot; but at dusk, just
as we had completed our movement, a heavy rain set in.
We were in close proximity to a watchful enemy, and were
obliged to maintain the utmost vigilance and quiet. We had
no blankets nor shelter of any kind, and were not allowed to
kindle fires, and, in consequence, passed a most dreary and uncomfortable
night. Troops were marching in rear of our
line all night, and before daylight our brigade was withdrawn
and moved forward on the Telegraph road southward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

ON THE NORTH ANNA AND THE PAMUNKEY.</h2>


<p>The great army was once more on the march, and another
"left-flanker" was in progress. At six o'clock, on Sunday
morning, we halted an hour for breakfast. At seven the
march was resumed. The day was pleasant and very hot,
relieved by a half hour's rain at noon. Our brigade was
separated from the remainder of the corps, which had marched
during the previous night while we had been holding the
river fords. During our noon halt all the trains of the army
passed us, together with the head-quarters' guard, and the
rebel prisoners captured in the recent battles. The noon
halt was at Guiney Station. In the afternoon we marched
in the direction of Bowling Green, toward the North Anna
river, and our brigade had the rear of the column on this
road. The march that day was very pleasant. We had
emerged from the dense forests of the Wilderness and Spottsylvania
to an open and beautiful farming country, abounding
with well-tilled fields and fine dwellings, which bore evidences
of comfort and plenty, unscathed by the desolations of war.
As we advanced southward the roads improved, and our
march was very rapid. At five o'clock we came up with the
remainder of our division, and continued the march until
nightfall, when we bivouacked near Bethel Church, having
marched sixteen miles.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the march was resumed, but the
roads were so crowded with the wagon-trains and artillery
that the progress was very slow, and we did not fairly commence
our day's work till three o'clock in the afternoon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
roads having by that time been partly cleared we pushed
along with great rapidity, our ears being every few minutes
greeted with the distant booming of artillery. Our speed
was not abated until about dark, when we approached the
North Anna river at Ox Ford. We bivouacked for the night
by the roadside near Chesterfield Church, and were lulled to
sleep by the din of moving battalions and the steady fire of
the skirmishers.</p>

<p>Grant's movement to the North Anna had been observed
by Lee. The operation, which in the presence of a wary
foe is one of the most hazardous, had been conducted with
great skill and complete success; yet the enemy, possessing
the direct road to the river, had been enabled to move with
great rapidity, while the march of our army had to be made
cautiously over comparatively unknown roads. When, therefore,
we reached the river we found the enemy prepared to
dispute its passage. The army of the Potomac reached the
North Anna on the afternoon of the 23d, at three points,&mdash;the
Fifth and Sixth Corps, on the right, at Jericho Ford; the
Ninth near Ox Ford; and the Second, on the left, at the
Chesterfield bridge. The river at the points where the army
reached it makes a bend to the south, and then immediately
to the north-east, thus nearly forming two sides of a triangle.
Lee's army was in a strong position, the centre resting opposite
General Burnside's position at Ox Ford, with his flanks
drawn back, the line of battle being nearly in the form of the
letter V; or, as a rebel author aptly writes, Lee had "inserted
a wedge of gray tipped with steel," in the centre of
Grant's line. The Fifth and Sixth Corps crossed the river
to the right, and the Second, after sharp fighting at the
bridge on the left.</p>

<p>When the passage at Ox Ford, between the two wings of
our army, was attempted by General Burnside, it was resisted
with great spirit; and it being impracticable to attack at that
point, although a portion of the corps crossed the river, the
Ninth Corps was divided, and our division assigned to General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Hancock to coöperate in the movement on the left. The
24th was excessively hot. The men were obliged to lie in an
open field exposed to the sun, and suffered much from the
heat. Soon after daylight the picket fire deepened into a
heavy and continuous discharge of musketry, mingled now
and then with artillery. At two o'clock came the order
"Fall in!" and in a moment we were on our way toward the
river which separated us from General Lee's position. Just
before we reached the river a brief halt was ordered. We
had moved out in column, and the Thirty-sixth had the left.
When we resumed the march we faced by the left, and moved
by a circuitous route through the woods to Chesterfield
bridge, passing the hospitals of the Second Corps. Upon
reaching General Hancock's head-quarters Colonel Curtin
reported to that officer in person, who ordered us to cross
the river at once. We were, however, obliged to wait for
some time, while other troops and batteries were crossing, and
were exposed to a severe artillery fire, which would have
been very destructive had the guns been better served. We
also encountered a severe fire as we crossed Chesterfield
bridge, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>

<p>After crossing the river Captain Barker was directed to
push on without waiting for the brigade, with orders to report
to any officer of General Hancock's staff. We passed
through a strong line of works captured early in the day by
Birney's division of the Second Corps, and were ordered to
relieve a Pennsylvania regiment of Mott's brigade, which
had been deployed in the woods as skirmishers. This duty
was at once performed, when General Hancock, who had
come out to look at the ground, ordered us to push forward,
with the remark, "See if you can find any rebels." The
regiment advanced gallantly with a fine line, considering its
length and the dense forest. In a few minutes a sharp
rattling fire proved that we had found the enemy and in
strong force. We continued the advance until we neared a
large clearing,&mdash;an open, level field, across which, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
edge of the woods, could be seen the enemy's entrenched
picket line and the strong main line beyond. A charge
across this field would entail fearful loss, for the rebels were
burrowed in their works and could pour a most destructive fire
upon our line. By this time the remainder of the division
had come into line in our rear, and in a little while had a
line of log breastworks erected. We were ordered to cover
the front of our division, and it became necessary to extend
our right to the bank of the river, which at this point was
very high and steep. The enemy were well posted, and the
fire of their sharp-shooters was very annoying and fatal.
Company A lost Sergeants May and Derby, two of its best
men, within five minutes after the line was extended. At
the same time the left was extended, and our line, though
thin, was in good position.</p>

<p>While these movements were in progress a most furious
thunder-shower, which had threatened for some hours, burst
upon us in great violence. The rain poured in torrents, and the
blinding lightning and rolling thunder mingling with the volleys
of musketry and crash of artillery produced an impression
calculated to inspire terror in the stoutest heart. The storm
was so severe as for a time to put a stop to the firing while
the battle of the elements continued. After the fury of the
tempest had somewhat abated the picket-firing was actively
renewed. Just before dark General Potter came out to
examine the position, and while inspecting the picket line
narrowly escaped death from the fire of the sharp-shooters.
He was mounted, and presented a good target for their fire.
He was cautioned of his danger and the nearness of the
enemy, but answered only with an indifferent "Humph!" and
after he had completed his inspection, which seemed unnecessarily
long, turned and rode leisurely away, to the evident
relief of his companions.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding a heavy rain, which continued the greater
part of the night, and our cheerless and exposed position, a
steady fire was kept up all along the picket line, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
enemy's fire was unusually hostile. The returning daylight
revealed the entrenchments of the enemy across the clearing
in our front to be much nearer than we had realized in our
advance in the previous twilight. They were very strong,
protected by a formidable abatis, and were well filled with
troops, who poured upon us a very close and effective fire.
Our position, although somewhat protected by detached rifle-pits
thrown up the night before, was greatly exposed and
very dangerous. Soon after daylight the left of the regiment
was advanced a short distance, for the purpose of correcting
the formation of the picket line. The work was
accomplished under a severe fire, by which Luke Doyle of
K, and Corporal Rice of C, were badly wounded. By slow
degrees the picket-pits were extended, and by noon the line
was made continuous and afforded a good protection. At
four o'clock that afternoon the regiment was relieved, and
posted in rear of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania in the line of
battle, having lost one man killed and four wounded.</p>

<p>During the 26th the brigade was under arms all day. The
Second Brigade, supported by a portion of our own, attacked
and drove back the whole line of the enemy's skirmishers in
our front, and established a new line farther in advance.
The works of the enemy were now reconnoitred, and found
to be so strong as to make an attack impracticable; accordingly
the anticipated assault was not made. The rain continued;
but the arrival of an unusually large mail caused
much joy in camp, and more than compensated for the
drenching we sustained. At nine o'clock that evening Captain
Smith, brigade officer of the day, advanced the entire
skirmish line, under a sharp fire of musketry and artillery.
Our brigade was then relieved by a brigade of Birney's
division, and quietly withdrawn across the river, the Thirty-sixth
leading the division line. After stumbling about in
the mud and darkness for some five miles, the brigade, at
two A.M., bivouacked near Mount Carmel Church, on the
same ground occupied by us on the night of the 23d. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
operations of the last four days had been extremely exhausting.
The constant strain by day and night, the exposure to
storm, and all the dangers and fatigue incident to such a
campaign, began to tell seriously upon the command. The
effective strength of the regiment now was ten commissioned
officers and two hundred and thirty-six enlisted men.</p>

<p>On the 27th orders bearing date of May 25th were promulgated
from General Grant's head-quarters, consolidating
the Ninth Army Corps with the Army of the Potomac.
Heretofore it had been an independent command, receiving
directions from General Grant. By this arrangement General
Burnside, although senior in rank to General Meade,
placed himself voluntarily under his command, and, with
characteristic unselfishness, generously waived all considerations
of rank and military etiquette for the good of the service.</p>

<p>During the forenoon of the 27th the corps was concentrated
near Mount Carmel Church. Early in the afternoon the
third flanking movement commenced. Each of these movements
had brought us face to face with the enemy strongly
intrenched to dispute our further progress. Each time, after
days of toil and bloodshed, without gaining any material
advantage, we had been withdrawn to renew the struggle at
some other point. This movement was secretly and successfully
accomplished. Not a picket shot was fired, and the
enemy did not seem to be aware of the withdrawal. In the
march the Second Division had the rear of the column, and
we moved in a south-easterly direction, toward the Pamunkey
river. The roads were so obstructed by wagon trains and
artillery that it cannot be said that we <em>marched</em> until night.
We caught two or three hours' sleep at intervals during the
evening, but after nine o'clock the halts were less frequent
until about one o'clock, when we bivouacked by the roadside,
after a toilsome march of about twelve miles.</p>

<p>At daylight on the 28th the camp was astir. At seven
o'clock the march was resumed, and we passed through a fine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
open country, level and well cultivated. The march, however,
was as tedious as that of the day before. The regular
roads were given up to the immense trains, and the troops
were obliged to make their way across fields and bottom
lands. At noon we had an hour's rest for dinner, and at
half-past two we halted on the grounds of an extensive plantation,
where the corps was massed. Corps head-quarters
were at the mansion-house. It was a princely establishment,
surrounded by the cabins of the slaves, and from appearances
"all the hands" were at home. We expected to camp at
this place; but, after an hour's halt, greatly to our disappointment
we were ordered forward.</p>

<p>The Second Division now had the right. The march was
severe, and many fell out exhausted. Occasionally a halt
was ordered, and the men dropped in the road for rest,
and many had to be aroused to prevent them from being run
over by the galloping artillery. It was emphatically a forced
march. The roads were ablaze with burning rails, and the
tall pines on fire presented a most picturesque and brilliant
scene for those who could keep their eyes open long enough
to enjoy it. Soon after midnight, near Hanover Town, we
reached the Pamunkey river, which we crossed on the pontoon
bridge at one o'clock, and half an hour later bivouacked about
two miles from the river. It was noticed that there was no
playing "High, Low, Jack" to determine who should go for
the water or cook the coffee. Every man dropped in his
place, completely exhausted from the effects of a night march
of more than twenty miles.</p>

<p>At four o'clock on the 29th we were again aroused, moved
forward a few miles, and halted in the woods by the roadside
while the Fifth Corps passed to the front. Soon after noon
we were ordered to the rear, and halted for rest in a pine
grove, through which flowed a stream of water in close proximity
to the wagon train. It was Sunday; surely rest was
never more welcome to wearied, jaded men. It was the first
rest deserving the name since the 20th, at Spottsylvania.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Here we pitched our tents, and the men availed themselves
of a fine opportunity for washing clothes, and overhauling
their sadly diminished wardrobe. The evening was bright
and beautiful. The head-quarters' band near us discoursed
patriotic and sacred music and songs of home, and the memory
of that pleasant Sabbath is undimmed even at this lapse
of time. To many it was the last Sabbath on earth. The
next dawned upon their lowly graves in the swamps of the
Chickahominy!</p>

<p>At eight o'clock on Monday, the 30th, we moved out of
camp, and soon joined the remainder of the division at
Hawes' shop. An intelligent guideboard informed us we
were only twelve miles from Richmond. Line of battle was
soon after formed, and an advance ordered. The enemy was
in a strong position, and the skirmishing was very sharp.
The division halted in the road while the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania
cleared the ground in our front by a gallant charge,
when the division crossed a creek, and advanced about half
a mile by the right flank into an open plain, where we formed
line of battle under the personal direction of General Potter,
who himself placed the guides. Here we were ordered to
intrench, and soon had a good line of rifle-pits, while a heavy
skirmish line was deployed in the woods in our front. The
Second Corps was upon our right, our corps occupying a
position between the Second and Fifth Corps. Strong reconnoissances
were made on the roads leading toward the
Chickahominy and Richmond. The firing was very heavy,
and the rebel army was found to be in strong position on the
line of the Totopotomoy. Again having the direct road they
were enabled to confront us with their entire army strongly
intrenched. The result of the movements of this day was to
secure ground well up to the enemy's lines; but no decisive
action was fought.</p>

<p>On the 31st, in the afternoon, an advance was ordered.
We left our strong works in the plain, and moved forward in
line to the woods, and supported a gallant attack of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Second Brigade, made in connection with the Second Corps.
We advanced about three-quarters of a mile over what General
Potter reported to be the worse ground he ever knew.
The firing was very brisk, but being in the second line our
loss was slight. The enemy was found to be strongly intrenched;
but the attack forced him out of a line of skirmish
pits, which were captured by our division, and the troops
pushed closely up to the enemy's main line. The picket line
was established with great difficulty, after severe fighting.
The line of battle was now in a dense forest, reminding us
of the Wilderness, and we occupied the remainder of the
afternoon in preparing for a general attack. We connected
on the right with Birney's division of the Second Corps, and
were ordered to advance with the right or left, as the occasion
might demand. On our right General Hancock attempted
to force the enemy's line; but the resistance was so
determined that no advantage was gained. A strong line
of works was erected, and the men slept on their arms, ready
to repel an attack.</p>

<p>Early the next morning a battery of six Napoleon guns
was brought up and put in position immediately in rear
of our regiment, and opened fire on the enemy. At the
same time heavy skirmishing was resumed, and the line
was prepared to assault the works in our front. General
Birney was to attack on the right, and our movement was to
conform to his. His troops moved out; but the works in his
front were found to be very formidable, protected in front
by marshy ground and a strong abatis, and the approaches
enfiladed with artillery. In moving forward General Birney
uncovered a battery, and he was obliged to suspend the
attack. The men were under arms all day, ready to move
forward or to the right or left. It was a long day of anxiety
and suspense. Later the enemy made a fierce attack upon
the two divisions on our left, but was handsomely repulsed,
with heavy loss. Toward night he advanced a strong line
to attack our division. He advanced in fine order, under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
heavy fire; but, not liking the appearance of our works,
prudently retired. The fighting all along the line was very
severe. Much artillery was used, but no special advantage
was gained.</p>

<p>About midnight we were aroused by whispered orders to
move by the right flank, and with the utmost secrecy, to the
rear. Long before daylight we were in position in the line
of works built by us on the 30th of May. The Second Corps
had been withdrawn from our right and moved to the left of
the army. We were ordered to be in constant readiness for
a rapid movement. While waiting here some of our comrades
of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, seized with a sudden
attack of the Eastern Tennessee foraging mania, visited a
recently deserted house in our rear. Upon searching the
premises they found some hams and bacon sides buried in the
cellar, and, on pursuing their investigations further, dug up,
not hams, but bags of silver coin, which the owner had
secreted. The amount found, it is said, was more than
$3,000, besides a considerable amount in gold. The lucky
miners carried on a profitable brokerage business for an
hour, and soon the silver coin, exchanged for currency, was
everywhere throughout the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

AT COLD HARBOR.</h2>


<p>At one o'clock we were ordered to the left, and moved by
the left flank. The heat was intense, and the roads dusty.
After marching about two miles that portion of the corps
which had left the line was massed in an open field near General
Meade's head-quarters, in rear of the Fifth Corps right.
Almost as soon as we halted we were overtaken by a furious
shower, which soon settled into an easterly storm. The
rain poured in torrents, and each one was sheltering himself
as much as possible, when the enemy made an attack.
Rhodes' division of Ewell's corps, supported by Hill and
Gordon, had been thrown forward along the road from
Hundley's Corner, and had struck the skirmish line that
covered our flank. The corps was at once put in position
to resist the enemy's advance. The movement was on
open ground, and the only corps manœuvre we had witnessed
during the campaign. It was directed by General
Burnside in person. The corps moved in three long lines
by division fronts, and presented a splendid spectacle. It
was a review under fire. When we came into position
the First Division was in the front, on high ground near
Bethesda Church. The Second and Third Divisions supported
the First. Two batteries of artillery opened upon the
advancing enemy, who replied with artillery and musketry,
and for a time there was a brisk duel. The attack of the enemy
was handsomely repulsed, although, in the surprise occasioned
by his first attack upon the skirmish line of the First
Division, he succeeded in capturing a large number of prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Toward dusk the division was moved by the right flank to
extend the line of battle in that direction, and a line of rifle-pits
was thrown up. Later in the evening we advanced farther
to the right and front, where the brigade was massed,
and ordered to bivouac for the night. The men had hardly
time to roll themselves in their blankets when the Thirty-sixth
was sent for to prolong the line of the Second Brigade. It
was raining hard when the regiment moved out. We halted
in rear of the left of the Second Brigade line, which formed
the extreme right of the army. In front of us and to the
left was a line of deserted intrenchments, which the regiment
was now ordered to occupy. This was a very hazardous operation.
We were ignorant of the position, but knew that
the enemy was in the immediate vicinity, if not in the very
works we were ordered to occupy. Not a ray of light illumined
the more than midnight darkness. The trees were
dripping with moisture and every drop sounded like a footfall.
As discovery would frustrate the entire plan, the men
were sent in singly, each being cautioned to move quietly.
We were obliged to use the utmost vigilance, and as it was,
we drew some shots in moving in. We soon discovered the
enemy to be on the other side of our line of pits, but a little
on our left. A long, anxious night followed, a fitting prelude
to the fearful day to follow.</p>

<p>We now fully comprehend what then we could not clearly
understand. Of the previous movements we had been able to
form some conception; but the operations since crossing the
Pamunkey, conducted rapidly in jungles, swamps, and labyrinths
of forest; in storm and darkness; by marches and countermarches,
advances and withdrawals,&mdash;all seemed to us to be
without consistent plan or purpose. But these operations had
been necessary to develop the strong position of the enemy
along the line of the Chickahominy, covering the railroad approach
and the principal roads leading to Richmond. The only
direct path to the Confederate capital lay across this noted
stream, which one writer says may be regarded as a wet ditch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
in front of the outer fortifications of Richmond. In order to
further advance upon his chosen line, it was necessary for
General Grant to force a passage of this stream. The enemy's
position along its front was so strong and unassailable that no
course seemed open except to extend the left, and, by a movement
lower down, outflank his right, and endeavor to pass
the Chickahominy at Cold Harbor.</p>

<p>On the first day of June Grant sent the Sixth Corps and
other troops to take possession of Cold Harbor at the left
extremity of the line, it being the junction of important roads
leading to White House Landing, Dispatch Station, Hanover,
and Richmond. It commanded these divergent roads, and
was of particular importance, as it covered the road leading
to the base of supplies at White House. The place was occupied
after a sharp struggle, and the severe attack of the
enemy to repossess the place had been handsomely repulsed.
That evening General Grant determined there to force the
passage of the Chickahominy, and drive Lee's army within
the intrenchments of Richmond. For this purpose the Second
Corps had been withdrawn from our right, and massed on the
left during the night of the 1st. The enemy had detached
correspondingly to his right, and the terrific shower in the
afternoon, while it interrupted Grant's plan of attack, did not
prevent the enemy from crowding all his available troops
toward Cold Harbor, and perfecting his arrangements for defence.
Our line was now being contracted and prepared to
attack. Though the manœuvre during the afternoon had been
intercepted, the enemy had gained no special advantage in following
up our movement. Our line extended from near
Bethesda Church on the right, to the Dispatch Station road
at Barker's Mills on the left, a distance of about six miles.
The Second Corps was now on the extreme left, the Second
Division of the Ninth Corps held the extreme right. We were
on historic ground. Two years before this had been the
scene of several of the great battles between the armies of Lee
and McClellan, with the positions, however, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
changed. That soil had drank the blood of thousands of our
gallant comrades; it was again to drink the blood of thousands
more.</p>

<p>The orders had been issued for a general assault along the
entire line at daybreak, and the final preparations were now
being made. As we have already said, the night was stormy
and intensely dark. The men had no shelter, and could not
sleep, and suffered much discomfort. Just before day the
regiment, with one or two others of the Second Brigade, was
withdrawn from the woods and ordered to construct a new
line of breastworks. This work was prosecuted with all
possible despatch, and was nearly completed when, most unexpectedly,
the regiment was ordered to join our own brigade,
then forming for attack. Without a moment's delay, though
weary, hungry, and cold, these brave men leaped the breastworks
and formed on the extreme left of the brigade, joining
it on the double-quick. The line was short. The brigade
had dwindled to a handful compared with its former numbers,
but for the beauty and military precision with which it
moved across the field it could challenge no superior in any
corps of the army. The enemy's heavy skirmish line was
posted in the edge of the forest, and, as we approached the
woods, opened a sharp fire. Our rapidly advancing line
caused them hurriedly to withdraw. As we neared the woods
a withering volley swept the line. At the first fire the brave
Color-Sergeant, Adams E. French, of Company D, who had
borne the national colors in all the battles of the campaign,
received a mortal wound, and fell in the line. The hands
of the gallant Corporal Stevens, of Company K, caught the
flag, and it did not reach the ground. The regiment pressed
forward under a galling fire, pressing toward the right, and
the enemy was driven rapidly across a creek, through a
swampy morass, over a ridge, and into their strong intrenchments,
within a few yards of the Shady Grove road, upon
which was their main line. It was with great difficulty that
a line could be maintained in the dense jungle under such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
deadly fire. It was Spottsylvania over again. We were
even nearer to the enemy's works. Captain Barker, commanding
the regiment, looked to the connection on the right,
while Captain Smith gave attention to the left. As we
moved forward, a rise of ground in our front afforded slight
protection; but when we reached the crest the fire was
terrific. The men held up to the work nobly. Comrades
were falling on every side, and very few escaped without
slight bruises, or having clothing cut by flying balls.</p>

<p>The right of the brigade encountered a strong line of works
in open ground, covered by artillery in position, which could
not be overcome. We on the left were exposed to the fire
from the enemy's intrenched line, not ten rods distant, and
our flank was entirely exposed to a heavy cross-fire. Having
no support, it was impossible to advance or retire. As at
the Wilderness and Spottsylvania, we were on the extreme
left, with no protection on that flank. The enemy's line was
longer than ours, and as the shots came in from the flank,
with the recollection of those dread days fresh in mind, two
companies, B and K, were deployed far to the left to keep up
a show of numbers, and prevent a surprise on the part of the
enemy. The ammunition was soon exhausted, and the cartridge-boxes
of the killed and wounded comrades were
emptied for a fresh supply. We were ordered not to give
an inch of ground. Men crawled to the rear and rolled
fallen trees and logs up the slope to the top of the crest, and
loosened the soil with their bayonets, and scooped up the
earth with tin cups and plates, until inch by inch they secured
some protection. As soon as a slight cover was raised, and
the supply of ammunition replenished, a close and deadly
fire was opened on the rebel line in response to their murderous
volleys. The colors were placed upon the works, and
during the day were flying in the face of the enemy. In our
advance the enemy opened upon us with four pieces of
artillery posted in an earthwork. Our attack was made with
so much dash and vigor that the right of the brigade secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
a position which commanded the enemy's guns and prevented
them from using the pieces. Two caissons were blown up,
many of the men and horses were killed by our fire, and the
guns stood silent and harmless throughout the day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were exposed to a merciless fire from the
rebel sharp-shooters, who were stationed in the tops of trees
within their works; but after a few hours we got their range,
and were enabled to inflict some damage, which had the
effect to slacken their fire. Late in the forenoon General
Griffin's brigade, in moving around our right, secured a
position from which it could make a successful advance, and
force the enemy across the Shady Grove road. An attack
was ordered, to be delivered at one o'clock, and preparations
were made to advance at that time, in connection with an
attack by our entire corps; but before that hour the order
was countermanded on account of the failure of the assault
along the left, at Cold Harbor.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, and again toward night, the
enemy opened a furious fire on our brigade, under cover of
which they attempted to draw off their artillery by <em>prolonge</em>;
but our men had such perfect range, and poured in such a
close fire, that their object could not be accomplished. At
sunset a brigade of the First Division moved up and connected
with our left, and Companies B and K returned to
their original position in the line of battle. At nightfall
videttes were posted, and thus ended a dark and bloody day.</p>

<p>The loss in our brigade had been especially severe.
Many of its best officers and bravest soldiers had fallen
before that fearful fire, and had fought their last battle.
The loss in the regiment was proportionately greater than
at the Wilderness or Spottsylvania; in fact, it was the most
destructive battle in which we were ever engaged. As
nearly as can be ascertained we carried into action that
morning eight commissioned officers and two hundred
enlisted men. From that short line we lost eight killed
and forty-nine wounded, ten of them mortally&mdash;a total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of fifty-seven. Seven of this number belonged to the
Forty-sixth New York detachment. Of the commissioned
officers Captain Barker, commanding regiment, and First
Lieutenant Burrage were wounded by minie balls, the
former in the arm, the latter in the shoulder. Captains
Smith and Ames were struck, but not seriously injured. The
proportion of non-commissioned officers, killed and wounded,
was very large. The regiment was deprived, also, of some of
its bravest and most faithful men. One of the first to fall
was Color-Sergeant French, of Company D. He had won a
reputation for bravery and coolness of which any soldier
might be proud. During the entire campaign he had carried
the national color through leaden hail, and on long and
weary marches, never for a moment flinching in the face of
danger, hunger, thirst, or weariness. While the line was
securing a foothold in front of the enemy's works, we experienced
the most terrific fire, and sustained the severest
loss. It was there that nearly all the brave men who fell
went down. It was there that we lost Acting Sergeant
Major Humes, who was struck down by a mortal wound in
the chest, while he was bravely cheering on the men. He
had rejoined the regiment but three weeks before, having
been on recruiting service at home; but in that brief time
he had won the esteem and confidence of all by his cool,
intrepid bearing. The heaviest loss fell upon Company D.
Its loss of nine men, four of whom were mortally wounded,
was a repetition of Spottsylvania.</p>

<p>Although inured, as the regiment was, to scenes of blood
and carnage, to loss and toil and suffering, the sacrifices
of this dark day could not be recounted in any spirit other
than that of deep sorrow and pain. The "faithful unto
death" were mourned as on no previous day by the little
remnant who survived. It seemed to us that they were too
brave and good and noble to fall in the dark hour of battle in
those dripping woods, without the knowledge or the hope even
of success. Every company had lost some of its best and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
most faithful men; some who had been in every scene of
strife hitherto, and whose calm, hopeful, and even happy
spirits had often cheered and sustained the despondent, and
imparted fresh life and courage to those who were ready to
faint. They would be missed in every added battle, in every
hour of future trial and gloom. The regiment would never
again seem quite the same without them; the lonely picket
would be more lonely, the long marches longer and more
fatiguing, the camp-fire and bivouac less cheerful, because they
had gone. But the sudden rupture of earthly ties could not
and cannot sever the bond that united the living and the valiant
dead; and we thought of them that night as more than
ever comrades bound to us by ties of battle-blood.</p>

<p>It had been a disastrous day, not alone to our regiment, but
to the entire army. The assault along the whole line had
been repulsed. No advantage had been gained, and the loss
was upwards of ten thousand men.</p>

<p>The detachment of the Forty-Sixth New York Regiment
serving with the Thirty-Sixth Regiment lost one man killed
and six wounded.</p>

<p>We expected to be relieved at night, having had no sleep
for forty-eight hours; but, after waiting two hours for a
fresh brigade to arrive, we received orders that no relief could
be furnished, and that we must hold the line.</p>

<p>At daylight our videttes reported that the enemy had retired
or was lying low for an attack. They cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
advanced and found the works deserted, and a strong reconnoitring
party, under Captain Ames, was sent out to discover
their whereabouts. No trace of the enemy could be discovered;
but they had left many dead unburied, and several
wounded on the field, together with much artillery, ammunition,
and several hundred muskets. From the wounded we
learned that we had fought Cook's brigade (five North Carolina
regiments), of Heth's Division, A. P. Hill's corps, and that
the regiment opposed to us was the North Carolina Tigers.
Their losses had been more severe than ours. Our fire had
been very destructive, judging from the new-made graves and
the dead found upon the ground. Large numbers of dead
horses were found near the position occupied by their artillery,
and the vain endeavor to drag off the guns must have
been very costly to the enemy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the brigade was withdrawn to the left,
and relieved a portion of Birney's division of the Second
Corps, near the Tucker house. On that day the German detachment
of the Forty-sixth New York, which had been connected
with the Thirty-sixth since March 19th, rejoined their
regiment, which had returned to the corps, leaving the effective
strength of our regiment six commissioned officers and
one hundred and sixty-eight enlisted men.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 5th the brigade line was changed.
The right was drawn back and extended, holding the ground
near Tucker's. The regiment worked all night, and by daylight
had built a strong breastwork. The enemy opened a
furious artillery fire in the morning from the two batteries
near the Tucker house, but the loss was slight, considering
the range and rapidity of the firing. Among the wounded in
this fire was Solon Carter, of Company A, whose foot was
torn off by a shell. He was one of the coolest and bravest
men in the regiment, and bore his terrible wound with wonderful
calmness. A heavy attack was made on the extended
picket line, and the pickets were driven out; but toward
night Captain Holmes went out with a reinforcement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
restored the line, after a sharp skirmish, in which he captured
four prisoners belonging to a North Carolina regiment.</p>

<p>The operations of the 7th were a repetition of those
of the 6th on a more extended scale. The division was
exposed to a most furious shelling from the batteries on the
hill, which, however, caused no loss in our regiment. Captain
Smith was brigade officer of the day, and while out in
the afternoon with a large working-party was suddenly
attacked by a strong force of the enemy, who drove in the
skirmish line with a rush. They advanced a line of battle,
broke our line, and captured a portion of the working party,
consisting of details from the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania and
Fifty-eighth Massachusetts. Captain Smith narrowly escaped
capture. In the attack Aaron Edmister, of Company B, was
mortally wounded. The enemy did not advance beyond the
skirmish line, and at six o'clock the line was reinforced, and
ordered forward, and General Potter detailed our regiment
to support the attack, and went out with us to retake the
hill. We were exposed to a severe fire, but took shelter
behind a rise of ground in our front as we lay in reserve,
and suffered no loss. As we advanced the enemy fell back.
At sunset a truce of two hours prevailed along the contending
lines, excepting on our front, for the purpose of burying
the dead. A white flag was sent out from our brigade head-quarters;
but the bearer met with such a hot fire that he was
obliged to return. After the truce the firing became general
along the line.</p>

<p>The regiment remained in line of battle outside our works
all night, and in the morning advanced to support the attack
of our skirmish line. The rebel skirmishers were driven
out of the pits, and across a field, over the top of the hill,
into the woods beyond. The hill was then fortified and
held, the entire brigade moving out and going into position.
Later in the day the brigade was moved to the right, and
after several halts went into line on the extreme right of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
division, at nearly a right angle with the line of battle, facing
a wide, open plain, the right resting on an impenetrable
swamp. At night the fire was very sharp and close, and the
men were under arms several times; but, with the exception
of the burning of three houses in front of the lines, nothing
unusual occurred.</p>

<p>For four days the regiment occupied this line. Being but
little exposed to the enemy's fire we enjoyed a season of
comparative rest and quiet, when not detailed for duty in the
skirmish line. The country around us was traversed with
intrenchments and field-works of every description, extending
in all directions. The duty in the picket pits was severe.
The enemy evidently expected another assault, and were
extremely hostile, narrowly watching every movement within
our lines, and constantly on the alert to detect any changes
in our position. During these days the company had been
gradually moved to the left, and concentrated behind strong
intrenchments, until at length preparations had been completed
for another change of base.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 12th, indications of a general movement
prevailed throughout the corps. Baggage was packed,
teams were loaded, rations issued and cooked. The long,
hot summer day passed wearily, and at dusk Captain Smith
was detailed as division officer of the day, and placed in
charge of the picket line, with orders to hold it until midnight
and then withdraw. At half-past eight o'clock the
brigade silently withdrew to the rear, and was soon on the
march. The night was excessively hot, the roads dusty,
and the halts were so brief and at such long intervals that
many of the men fell out exhausted. The road was crowded
with troops. The Ninth and Eighteenth Corps marched
side by side,&mdash;the latter destined for White House Landing,
to embark for City Point, on James river. About two
o'clock in the morning the regiment lost the right of the
brigade, and became merged with the troops of the Eighteenth
Corps, and kept on with them until daylight found us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
near White House. At half-past five, after an hour's search,
we rejoined the brigade near Tunstall's Station.</p>

<p>We rested during the forenoon while the corps was concentrating,
and were joined by Captain Smith, and the
picket detail. At one o'clock that afternoon we resumed
our march in a southerly direction, through forest and
swamps and across bottom lands. The march was very
rapid and well conducted. We halted at seven o'clock for
supper, resumed the march at eight, and bivouacked at half-past
twelve about three miles from the Chickahominy.
Early on the 14th the command was in motion. At nine
o'clock we crossed the Chickahominy, at Jones' bridge,
twenty miles from Richmond. We halted on its banks until
noon, when the march southward was resumed, through a
splendid farming country. The elegant mansions and well-tilled
lands presented a beautiful contrast to the battle-scarred
and fortified fields of Cold Harbor. The noble forests
had not yielded to the axes of the engineers, and the blight
and desolation of war were nowhere visible. We marched
by way of Charles City cross-roads and court-house, and
halted for supper on the splendid plantation once the home
of ex-President Tyler.</p>

<p>At sunset we were again on the road. At half-past eight
we passed the camps of the Sixth Corps, and the first and
third divisions of the Ninth. The men were gathered in
groups around piles of blazing rails, busily cooking their
evening meal; the bands were discoursing patriotic music,
and the whole scene was one of the most striking and magnificent
of war. At half-past nine we went into bivouac on
the bank of the historic James, at a point about three miles
below Wilcox's wharf, having made a laborious and painful,
yet most successful, march of fifty-five miles in less than
forty-eight hours.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG.</h2>


<p>The movement of the army to the James was one of the
most brilliant and successful of the war. It is one of the
few of Grant's manœuvres which commands the unanimous
approval of his enemies and severest critics. Swinton, in
his "Campaigns of the Army of the Potomac," says: "The
resolution to cross the James necessitated the total abandonment
of that system of action which aimed, while operating
against the enemy offensively, to directly defend the national
capital. Moreover the operation was in itself one of great
delicacy, a change of base being pronounced by Napoleon
the foremost master of war, 'the ablest manœuvre taught
by military art.' General Grant manifested as much moral
firmness in adopting a line of action which ... he
felt prescribed by the highest military considerations, as he
showed ability in executing this difficult operation. The
measure itself was not only entirely conformable to the true
principles of war, but its execution reflects high credit on
the commander, and merits the closest study."</p>

<p>The 15th of June was passed by our brigade quietly in
camp, awaiting the completion of the pontoon bridge, from
Douthard's to Windmill Point,&mdash;a distance of 2,200 feet,
across a river navigable by the largest ships. At sunset we
were ordered to draw four days' rations and be in readiness
to move at short notice. At eight o'clock marching orders
were received, and at nine o'clock we crossed on the pontoon
bridge. The river was filled with vessels of every kind, at
anchor,&mdash;transports, steamers, gunboats,&mdash;and presented a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
most spirited scene. Upon reaching the southern bank the
march was prosecuted with great vigor; and as only two
brief halts were made that night it proved to be one of the
most wearisome of the campaign. Soon after daylight we
halted near Prince George Court-House, for an hour, to make
coffee. While engaged in that pleasant and refreshing task
our ears were saluted by the sound of distant cannonading
in the direction of Petersburg. This was a signal that our
rest was to be of short duration.</p>

<p>It is no part of our purpose to criticise, or even narrate,
the chapter of mishaps and blunders which attended the
movement for the capture of Petersburg. It is sufficient to
state that the golden opportunity was now passing,&mdash;the
city which was defended by the militia had not been captured,
and the army of the Potomac was being hurried forward,
soon to cope once more with its old opponent, the veterans
of the army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>At half-past eight the march was resumed in the direction
of Petersburg. At ten o'clock we passed the line of earthworks
which constituted the outer defences of the city, which
were captured the day previous by the troops of the Eighteenth
Corps. At one o'clock we came up with the advanced
divisions of our own corps, already formed in line of battle
on the left of the Second Corps. At three o'clock we were
put in position on the extreme left, in the edge of a pine
forest. Directly in front, across an open plain about half a
mile in extent, stood the strong intrenchments of the enemy.
Their outposts were well advanced, and heavy skirmishing
was kept up on the right, and soon extended along the entire
line. We were ordered to attack at six o'clock. At that
hour the artillery opened, and the line moved forward across
the plain. The Second Brigade supported the attack made
by Barlow's Division of the Second Corps. Our regiment
and the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania were held in reserve, to
cover and protect the left flank, and extend the line should it
be necessary. The advance was most gallant and determined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
but was met by a fire of musketry and artillery which was
fearfully effective. The ground was quickly traversed, and
Barlow's division and Griffin's brigade succeeded in effecting
a lodgment in some rifle-pits, and this was the only important
result accomplished. Night came down upon the bloody
plain, but did not put an end to the terrible conflict, for the
enemy made several ineffectual attempts to regain the works
he had lost. The musketry fire was terrific at times, and
the battle throughout was fierce and bloody. Some ground
was gained on the right, but no impression was made on the
left. It was, however, determined to renew the assault at
daylight, and the Ninth Corps was selected to make the
attack.</p>

<p>After the assault on the 15th, which resulted in the capture
of a portion of his line, the enemy constructed a new line in
rear, connecting the enclosed works and redoubts of the old
line still in his possession, which were on our left. The principal
work, known as the Shand House redoubt, was very
strong, and able to resist a most determined assault. It was
nearly half a mile in front of his new main line, projected
as a salient. The only promise of successful assault seemed
to lie in capturing the line of breastworks connecting this
redoubt with those on the left. The portion of the rebel
lines in our front extended along the crest of a deep and
narrow ravine near the Shand house. The position was very
strong, and defended, as we afterwards learned, by five Tennessee
regiments, composing the Third Brigade of Bushrod
Johnson's Division of Infantry, supporting a battery of
artillery. On our left two guns in a redoubt completely
enfiladed the line of approach. The position seemed impregnable,
and failure would doubtless be attended with
fearful loss of life. A successful assault, however, would
force the enemy to abandon the redoubts; and General
Burnside believed the works could be stormed if the troops
could be formed in the ravine without the knowledge of the
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>To General Potter, the gallant commander of the Second
Division, was this most arduous and desperate task assigned.
He immediately prepared for its execution. In order to
reach the position it was necessary to make a wide detour to
the right. This of itself was a most difficult matter. The
slashing of pine timber presented a serious obstacle, and the
ground was full of gullies and ravines, and in moving over
them the command was much scattered. The enemy kept
up an annoying and incessant picket fire, which increased the
difficulties of the movement. Aware that a hazardous undertaking
was being executed, the men maintained the utmost
quiet, and obeyed every order with promptness and precision.</p>

<p>At length, nearly an hour past midnight, the column
reached the head of the ravine, and the hungry and thoroughly
exhausted men threw themselves on the ground, to
gain, if possible an hour's rest. They had enjoyed no rest
for more than forty-eight hours, and realized full well the
terrible business the returning light would bring. Many
in the brief half of that summer night closed their eyes in
what proved to be their last earthly sleep. Many, doubtless,
saw in dreams for the last time the faces of the dear
ones at home. But all did not sleep. These thought of the
past, of their childhood and homes, of the day whose dawn
they were awaiting,&mdash;a day to receive its second baptism of
patriot's blood! And who shall say that these true souls
were not filled with the same exalted devotion to Freedom
and Country which animated the heroes of Bunker Hill as
they toiled on that memorable night of June, 1775?</p>

<p>But to sleeping and waking, the night waned apace. The
moon which had been shining brightly now cast long shadows,
and darkness settled in the ravines. The rebel pickets in our
front grew drowsy, and through weariness ceased their
firing. No sounds were heard save the distant rumble of
wagons and artillery, the trickling of the brook in the ravine,
and the subdued breathing of the worn and weary men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
The mists from the stream ascended cold and gray, completely
obscuring the troops. The favorable moment had
arrived. Now if the lines could be formed in the ravine
success seemed certain. This, however, was most delicate
business. The enemy's pickets were on the hillside only
forty feet distant, while above, upon the crest of the ravine,
seventy-five feet beyond, stood the intrenchments filled with
men. The least noise or indiscretion would betray our presence,
and draw a murderous fire from the works above.
Success depended on secrecy. Profound silence was enjoined.
The tin dippers and canteens were placed in the
haversacks, to prevent the telltale jingle. Muskets were
loaded, but not capped, bayonets fixed, and orders given that
not a shot must be fired until the works were reached.</p>

<p>The men were now thoroughly aroused, and all signs of
weariness disappeared. The regiments were one by one
moved down the brookside into the dark ravine, and soon
the lines were formed. Griffin's brigade was on the right,
with the Seventeenth Vermont, Eleventh New Hampshire,
and Thirty-second Maine, in the front line; the remainder
supporting; Curtin's brigade on the left, with the Second New
York Rifles, Thirty-sixth Massachusetts, and Forty-eighth
Pennsylvania, in the front line. The Second New York Rifles
had the right, the Thirty-sixth the centre, and the Forty-eighth
the left. The remainder of the brigade were to support
the front line. Griffin was to charge toward the house
bearing to the right; Curtin to bear to the left, toward the
redoubt.</p>

<p>The hour fixed for the assault&mdash;three o'clock&mdash;drew on.
The word "Forward!" was whispered, and with cat-like steps
the men advanced. A fence obstructed the advance of our
brigade, and in attempting to remove it a rail was accidentally
dropped, and instantly a half-dozen shots from the works
above revealed the fact that the enemy was on the alert. For
a moment the plan seemed frustrated; but a death-like quiet
reigned in our line, and soon the enemy became reassured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, cautiously and quietly, the men crept forward. At
the given signal they rose erect, rushed for the picket line,
and carried it in an instant. Then, with one loud, ringing
cheer, like a billow of the ocean, irresistible and deadly, they
dashed on up the hill. On they went, right into the hot flash
of musketry and smoke of cannon, regardless of the wounded
and the dead, regardless of the fire, without a shrub to shield
them from the withering blast.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> In "The Virginia Campaign of '64 and '65," page 217, note, General
Humphreys, describing this action, quotes as follows, from a paper contributed
to the Massachusetts Military Historical Society, by General S. G. Griffin,
commanding Second Brigade:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"One gunner saw us approaching and fired his piece. That was all we heard
from them, and almost the only shot fired on either side. The rebels were
asleep with their arms in their hands, and many of them sprang up and ran
away as we came over; others surrendered without resistance."
</p>
<p>
While this statement is doubtless correct with reference to that portion of
the line attacked by General Griffin's brigade, it does not convey a true idea
of the stubborn, though short, resistance encountered by Curtin's brigade.
The fire at this point was very severe. The Second New York Rifles broke
under it, leaving only the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts and Forty-eighth Pennsylvania
in the front line. Between the brow of the hill and the enemy's line
the Thirty-sixth lost nineteen out of less than ninety men engaged, and the
loss reported by the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania was seventy-five killed and
wounded.</p></div>

<p>A fierce, though brief, struggle ensued at the works. As
the rebel commander was pulled over the breastworks as a
prisoner he shouted to his men, "Stand firm! Their right is
all gone!" The Second New York had broken in the first fire,
and left our right badly exposed. The Forty-fifth was sent
forward to protect the right, and the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts
extended the line to the left. The enemy discovered the
break in our line, and commenced a sharp cross-fire upon the
regiment. At this critical moment, Captain Smith, commanding
the regiment, with wonderful presence of mind, turned
toward the left, and shouted, at the top of his voice, "Fairbank!
bring up your brigade!" at the same moment yelling
"Charge!" The ruse had its desired effect, and before Lieutenant
Fairbank could hurry his brigade of eight men, o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>f
Company K, from the left the enemy wavered, our men
leaped the works at a bound, and captured all the defenders
who did not take to their heels.</p>

<p>In the desperate struggle acts of individual gallantry and
heroism were performed which time would fail to recount.</p>

<p>The line was carried and the enemy were driven from the
breastworks, the redoubts, and from a second line where they
attempted to rally. Four pieces of artillery were captured,&mdash;two
by the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania and our regiment; one
by the Seventeenth Vermont; and one by the Eleventh New
Hampshire; also the colors of the five regiments defending
the line, six hundred prisoners, and more than fifteen hundred
muskets and equipments and ammunition. The colors of the
Fourteenth New York Heavy Artillery, lost in the attack
the night before, were recaptured, nor were these the only trophies
of the victory,&mdash;an important point had been carried;
the rebels had been forced to take a new position; the Shand
house, Avery house, and more than a mile of ground, were
now in our possession. It was a great victory, but not what
it might have been. It was the old story over again,&mdash;a
most spirited and gallant attack without adequate supports.
Had a single corps been on the ground in position, or had the
divisions which were ordered to support us been ready to
advance, the fearful carnage of the two succeeding days
would doubtless have been prevented, and the long, tedious,
wasting, bloody siege of Petersburg might have been avoided.</p>

<p>None who participated in that attack will fail to remember
the morning of the 17th of June while life shall last. It was
the most brilliant and successful engagement in which the
regiment had ever had a part; and yet in many respects it
was one of the saddest days of our history. Though the
victory was ours, it had been purchased at a heavy cost.
The number of the regiment engaged was less than ninety
men, many having fallen out exhausted in the forced march
from the James; yet from that small number three were
killed, and sixteen wounded,&mdash;four of them fatally. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
thickest of the fight, amid the terrible energies of the battle,
these brave men fell martyrs to the cause of their country.</p>

<p>One of the first to fall was Captain Otis W. Holmes, of
Milford, commanding Company B, who received a mortal
wound. The regiment sustained no severer loss during its
term of service. Few men possessed in so marked and special
degree the respect and affection of his men. Strong and vigorous
in body and mind; a brave, fearless soldier; a cool,
sagacious adviser; careful and prudent of his men,&mdash;he was a
noble specimen of manhood, and an ideal soldier. It is much
to say of an officer that he was cool and brave, equal to any
emergency; but far more to say truly of him that he was pure,
good, and noble. All this can be truly said of Holmes. The
entire regiment had learned to love and esteem him, and his
untimely death was mourned by all who knew him.</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers contributed more than their
proportion to the loss sustained that day, and among the killed
and wounded were some of the bravest and best soldiers of
the regiment. The little line of battle was sadly dwindled,
and, after detailing a portion of the guard required in sending
the prisoners to the rear, there remained in the ranks but
forty-six enlisted men.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment in killed and wounded, June 17th,
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the wounding of acting Color-Sergeant Stevens, the
colors were taken by Corporal William Macomber, Company
E, and carried by him during the remainder of the regiment's
term of service.</p>

<p>But no time was allowed us to mourn over our fallen comrades;
the wounded were sent to the rear while preparations
were made for an advance. We pressed forward until the
enemy was found to be in a new position. The division also
formed a new line, in advance of the position we had carried,
the left resting on a redoubt in that line. The enemy advanced
a battery down the plank road and opened a severe fire. Soon
after, the front regiments of our brigade were relieved in the
advanced line, and found shelter from the artillery fire in the
ditch of the redoubt on the left, where we were exposed to a
severe shelling. Here we remained until half-past nine, when
the regiments which had formed the front line in the assault
were withdrawn to the woods half a mile in the rear for rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
after receiving warm words of praise from General Potter and
Colonel Curtin.</p>

<p>The battle raged almost without intermission during the
day. Charges were made by the First and Third Divisions
of our corps, and the tide of battle surged along the entire
front. About eight o'clock in the evening the regiment was
sent for, and moved across the plain to the front line. The
evening was very clear, the moon shone brightly, and as
we neared the works we attracted the attention of the enemy,
who opened upon us with artillery; but our batteries replied
and soon silenced the enemy's guns. We were put in position
in a line of works captured by the First Division, and
were engaged nearly all night in facing them about. The
enemy attempted to interrupt the work, without success.
A strong line of skirmishers was deployed, and the digging
was continued under an annoying fire of musketry.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th, at nine o'clock, we moved
out by the right flank to support an assault about to be
made by the Third Division. The attack was to have
been general along the entire line; but the enemy had fallen
back to a new line, and the assault was delayed until new
dispositions of the troops could be made. The line advanced
toward noon, through a belt of pine woods, into a clearing.
A portion of our brigade was in the front line. The Forty-eighth
Pennsylvania and our own regiment supported. After
leaving the woods the line advanced through a field of grain
toward the Taylor house, the rebel skirmish line falling
back to a cut of the Norfolk Railroad which afforded a deep
cover. The enemy was found to be strongly intrenched
beyond the railroad, with a winding ravine in front, through
which flowed a small creek, the banks of which immediately
in our front were covered with a dense thicket. Artillery
was ordered forward to cover the attack of the infantry, and
our regiment supported the gallant advance of Captain
Roemer's battery. The fire of the enemy was so close and
hot that he was obliged to leave his horses in the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the wood. He then put his guns in position in the open
field, run two guns by hand to a dilapidated building on
our right, and, although he lost several men, soon secured
some protection, got good range, and opened a rapid and
effective fire on the enemy.</p>

<p>Jones' Eleventh Massachusetts battery was soon after put
in position in rear of our left, and fired at such short range
that for a time we were obliged to "hug the ground," being
exposed to two fires,&mdash;from front and rear. His shells inflicted
great damage on the enemy, although they passed
uncomfortably near our own heads.</p>

<p>It being of the utmost importance to secure the railroad-cut,
the batteries opened a furious fire, under cover of which
the brigades in the front line, led by Generals Hartranft and
Griffin and Colonel Curtin, made a splendid charge, and succeeded
in driving the enemy out of the railroad-cut into their
works beyond.</p>

<p>The portion of our brigade was between Griffin and
Hartranft. The line of the railroad crossed our front diagonally,
and on our right, at the point where the enemy's main
line crossed the railroad, a small redoubt had been erected,
in which was placed a single piece of artillery. This gun
had perfect range of the railroad-cut, and completely enfiladed
our line with a severe fire of grape and canister. While
our line in this position was well protected from the fire in
front, it was exposed to this hot fire from the right flank.
The attention of our batteries was soon bestowed upon this
gun in the redoubt; and the men tore up the railroad-ties,
and erected a barricade which afforded them ample protection
from the fire.</p>

<p>It was now comparatively easy to hold the railroad-cut,
but to advance was quite another matter. The railroad-bank
was high, and so steep that the men had to dig holes in the
side of it to place their feet, and as soon as a man showed
his head above the bank he was a target for the rebel sharp-shooters.
On the left the troops moved forward as far as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
ravine. At three o'clock a general attack was ordered, but
the difficulties to be overcome were so great that a long delay
ensued in preparing the line for advance. At half-past five
the whole Third Division, and Second Brigade, and four
regiments of our brigade, made a determined attack on the
works, then defended by Kershaw's division of Longstreet's
veteran corps. Nothing could exceed the heroic daring of
the advance, under the fearful fire of the enemy at point-blank
range, covering every inch of the ground from the
railroad-cut to their earthworks. The line was strong and
well defended, yet, notwithstanding, all the ground from the
railroad to the ravine was carried; the ravine was crossed
and the crest beyond secured, and the ground held up to
within a little more than a hundred yards of the enemy's
works.</p>

<p>During this gallant attack Colonel Curtin, our brigade
commander, was severely wounded in the shoulder, and the
command devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Pleasants of the
Forty-eighth. At half-past five the regiment, being in support
of the batteries, was ordered to throw up a line of
intrenchments for protection from the sharp-shooters, who
were picking off the gunners. The loss during the afternoon
had been severe, considering the numbers of the regiment
and its position in the battle,&mdash;two men killed and seven
wounded.</p>

<p>After the last attack the firing slackened somewhat, and
was confined to the front line of battle, and it was fondly
hoped that the record of sacrifice and bloodshed for that day
was fully made up. The company cooks brought up the
coffee,&mdash;the only refreshment the regiment had received since
daylight. The men were huddled behind the low breastwork
eating supper, when the attention of Captain Buffum was
attracted by some movement in front, and he rose to ascertain
the cause. He had just remarked that he was the only
member of the large mess that crossed the Rapidan who had
escaped death or wounds, and laughingly said, "It is the rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
for all to be struck; but every rule has an exception." He
had scarcely risen to his feet when the fatal bullet, directed
by the unerring aim of the watchful rebel sharp-shooter,
struck him. He uttered a piercing cry, sprang into the air,
fell back, and in a few moments passed beyond the reach of
pain. The scene was witnessed by nearly all the regiment,
and sent a thrill of horror to every heart.</p>

<p>At any time his death would have been a severe loss; at
such a moment it came with almost crushing weight, and
seemed irreparable. He was the senior officer in years, and
then the second in rank of a fast-dwindling band. He was
beloved and respected by all, and his death cast deep gloom
over the entire regiment. We recalled his patience and
bravery during the entire campaign, the sorrow which seemed
to pierce his heart as he referred to the great losses of his
company, and especially the wonderful coolness he displayed
at Spottsylvania, when, in advance of the line, he received
the rebel fire, and returned to draw back the left wing and
save the regiment, if not the entire division, from capture or
death.</p>

<p>After dark, when the line had been established for the
night, the Adjutant was sent to corps head-quarters to beg
permission that the Captain's remains might be sent at once
to City Point for shipment to Massachusetts. General Burnside
was found lying prone on the ground under a tree. The
case was briefly stated. "Buffum," said he,&mdash;"is Buffum
dead? Why, he was in North Carolina with us! He was a
brave man&mdash;I remember him well. Oh!" he added, with
much emotion, "how fast these brave men are going!" Then
calling his Adjutant-General, the order necessary for the
removal of the body was given in terms which revealed his
noble, sympathetic nature.</p>

Surgeon Bryant, who had not been absent from the line an
hour, was on duty at the Field Hospital, and Quartermaster
Tuttle was in charge of the wagons and baggage. On the
6th of May we had twelve officers in the line of battle; we

<p>Late that evening General Potter relieved the Third

The Commanding General takes great pride in assuring this command of the high
appreciation in which their services, after the fatigues of the recent movement, are
held at the Head-quarters of the Army, and quotes with pleasure the expression used
by the Commanding General of the Army of the Potomac in speaking of the brilliant
assault on the morning of the 17th. He writes: "It affords me great satisfaction to
congratulate you and your gallant corps on the successful assault on the morning of
the 17th. Knowing the wearied condition of your men from the night march of over
twenty-two miles, and the continued movement through the night of the 16th, their
persistency and success is highly creditable."

The Commanding General can only add that in this, as in the previous and succeeding

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

IN THE TRENCHES.</h2>


<p>On the morning of June 19th the regiment was relieved from
duty in the front line, and withdrew to the pine woods from
which we advanced the day before. We were soon joined
by most of the men who had fallen out on the march, or had
failed to find the regiment in the constant changes of position,
and the effective strength reported at brigade head-quarters
was one hundred and fifty-one; commissioned officers four,
enlisted men one hundred and forty-seven. A strong line
of intrenchments was erected on the high ground near the
railroad. One hundred men were detailed for fatigue duty on
the line, and worked through that hot June day with pickaxe
and shovel. The enemy's firing was very close, and during
the night was quite severe. Our batteries kept up a steady
fire on the rebel lines.</p>

<p>The operations of the last two days had been conducted in
the hope of capturing Petersburg before the whole army of
Northern Virginia could be brought to the rescue. The enemy
had taken up a new line on commanding ground nearer the
city. The attack and repulse of the 18th had developed the
great strength of that line, and convinced the commanding-general
that further assault would be hopeless. The heroic
courage and desperate valor of the troops had availed only to
secure a strong position near the enemy's line. "No better
fighting has been done during the war," said General Burnside
in his report; but either the attacks had not been properly
directed or adequately supported. Orders were now issued
for the troops on the right to hold and strengthen the lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The 20th was but a repetition of the 19th. It was a noisy day
in the front; but being one of comparative quiet to us in the
woods, the time was improved in making up regimental reports
for the campaign from Spottsylvania, and a list of casualties.
Several vacancies existed among the commissioned
officers, in consequence of the deaths and resignations since
April 23d, and seven of the companies were commanded by non-commissioned
officers. On the 5th of June, at Hanover Town,
Captain Smith forwarded to Governor Andrew a list of recommendations
for promotion; but as no commissions had been
received, and the exigencies of the service required additional
officers, the duties devolving upon the few commissioned
officers present being onerous and severe, another list was made
up this day, and transmitted through the regular channels to
the Governor of the State. This list included the following
non-commissioned officers:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<ul>
<li>Sergeant Major Davidson to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em>
Ranlett, resigned.</li>

<li>First Sergeant Woodward to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em>
Cross, resigned.</li>

<li>First Sergeant Stearns to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em> Goodspeed,
resigned.</li>

<li>First Sergeant Haskell to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em> Hodgkins,
promoted.</li>

<li>First Sergeant Hancock to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em> Fairbank,
promoted.</li>

<li>Sergeant Olcutt to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em> Daniels, killed.</li>

<li>Sergeant Cross to be First Lieutenant, <em>vice</em> Burrage, promoted.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Sergeants White, Hancock, Wright, Woodward, and
Stearns had previously been recommended for commissions
as second lieutenants, but no officers in that grade could
be mustered, on account of the reduced numbers of enlisted
men. Major Draper, who at this time was in Massachusetts,
submitted to the Governor another list of recommendations
about this date; but before either list could receive attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
other changes became necessary, and all of the sergeants recommended
in the foregoing list, with the addition of First
Sergeant Harwood, were commissioned as first lieutenants.
Some of these brave and deserving men, who had nobly earned
their rank, were at this time absent on account of serious
wounds received during campaign, and before they could recover
and rejoin the regiment circumstances had arisen which
prevented their being mustered into the service in the rank
to which they were commissioned.</p>

<p>June 20th Captain Smith was detailed for court-martial
duty at division head-quarters, and the regiment was in command
of Captain Ames. At dusk a colored regiment from
the Fourth Division came up in our rear, and we anticipated
a night attack in force; but the men quietly laid aside their
equipments, and being furnished with pickaxes and shovels
went on fatigue duty in the front line. During the night
the firing was very severe. Our position, though not subjected
to the exposure of the front line, was under fire continually.
The bullets of the enemy rattled among the trees,
singing their death-song by day and night. On the night of
June 20th private John McGrath, Company I, was wounded
and sent to the rear. It was the third wound he had received
during the campaign. During these days the front, or main
line, was strengthened with abatis, and traverses, and a
covered way built to the rear.</p>

<p>On the 21st the regiment remained in the woods preparing
for a review, which had been ordered for the afternoon.
At four o'clock we were in line, and moved to the wide open
plain in rear of the woods, the scene of the action on the
17th. The First Brigade was reviewed by General Potter.
The Seventh Rhode Island was on the right of the line, and
the Second New York Mounted Rifles, acting as infantry
(recently assigned to this brigade), on the left. The review
was well conducted, and, considering the circumstances of
the occasion, the troops presented a fine appearance. To all
of us it was a novel parade,&mdash;marching to the music of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
bands, the discordant barking of the dogs of war, and the
distant screeching of the death-laden shells.</p>

<p>At midnight we were ordered to the main line to relieve
the Second Brigade, and the regiment was sent out on picket.
The night was very clear, and the moon being at the full
revealed everything about us as clear as daylight. The duty
of relieving the picket line was extremely hazardous, and it
was half-past two o'clock A.M. before the work was completed.
The men were obliged to crawl out singly from the
railroad-cut, and the men relieved were exposed to a close
and merciless fire in leaving the line. It was daylight before
our line was fairly in position, and we settled down to the
first day of the long siege-life before us. About sunrise the
cooks came out with coffee, and John L. Finney, cook of
Company K, received a shocking wound in the face, in consequence
of raising his head a little too high. His escape
from instant death was miraculous. After daylight it was
impossible for a man to look over the top of the pits. The
rebels fired twenty shots where we fired one, and their sharp
practice enabled them to skim the tops of the pits; their
shots were well aimed, and the bullets flew all about us.</p>

<p>The picket line itself was found to be very peculiar. It
was separated from the main line by the deep cut of the
Norfolk Railroad, which crossed our rear diagonally. The
ground on the right at the railroad was quite high, falling off
rapidly toward the swampy ravine on the left; the slope
being toward the enemy's line, which enabled them to command
all the ground between the railroad-cut and their own
line. The troops of the Second Brigade had worked industriously
to establish good cover for the picket-line; but the
position on the left was so dangerous, and so near the enemy,
that but little progress had been made in erecting a line of
pits at that point. There was a space of five or six rods
between Companies H and C, which could not be crossed by
daylight on account of its nearness to the rebel lines. During
the day the men on the right took up railroad sleepers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
from the track, and laid them on the tops of the pits; small
loop-holes were then made under the logs, and in this way
the men secured some protection for their heads while watching
a chance to fire upon the enemy. They were soon able
to inflict some damage on the sharp-shooters opposite.</p>

<p>By degrees some improvement was made on the left, but
the progress was very slow and tedious, as only one man
from each company, C and H, could work toward each
other, on account of the close fire. The left was in a bad
and dangerous condition. In the event of an attack which
we should fail to repulse, the whole line would be exposed
to capture, as it would be madness to attempt to escape to
the railroad and over the rising ground in our rear. The
enemy seemed to know that new troops were in the pits, and
were unusually hostile. They evidently anticipated an
attack, as a heavy movement was in progress on the left by
the Second and Fifth Corps, and a fierce fight raged about
three miles beyond the Jerusalem Plank road for the possession
of the Weldon Railroad.</p>

<p>It was thought in our lines that the enemy would make a
counter-attack, and the batteries in our rear lines kept up a
steady fire, while the men were constantly on the alert,
crouched in the narrow pits, ready to resist an attack. It
was a day long to be remembered,&mdash;our first day in the front
line of trenches. It was one of the longest and most tedious
days of our service; but how many such days were we to
experience! There we lay in the dust, under the blazing,
broiling midsummer sun, which beat full upon us, without a
leaf of intervening shade. The water in the canteens was
hot and sickening, and, to add to our discomforts the offensive
odors from unburied corpses around us were borne to us on
every breath of that sultry summer air. But the longest
day must end, and at last the sun declined, and the welcome
shades of evening settled on us. Quiet reigned for a little
while, but about ten o'clock the rebels were discovered
crawling up toward our left. A severe musketry fire was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
opened upon them, and they were forced to retire. After
midnight the firing ceased, and our pioneers buried some of
the dead bodies near us, and made some progress in perfecting
the picket line on the left. Jno. H. Barton, of Company
E, badly wounded in the abdomen, and Abiel Fisher, of G,
wounded in the arm, were the casualties in the trenches that
day.</p>

<p>At two o'clock on the morning of the 23d the Forty-eighth
Pennsylvania commenced to relieve our regiment in
the picket pits. Owing to the sharp firing the process was
slow and dangerous, but we reached the main line about half-past
two, and were allowed an hour's rest. At half-past
three we were aroused by orders to be ready to attack at any
moment. We were under arms throughout the day, and
were exposed to the fire of the enemy, by which Orin Taylor,
of F, was severely wounded, and the Adjutant of the
Fifty-eighth Massachusetts, standing near our right, was
killed. At nine o'clock in the evening the brigade was
relieved by the Second Brigade, and returned to the line in
the pine woods, after forty-eight hours' duty in the front.</p>

<p>During these few days, to quote from Captain McCabe's
"Defence of Petersburg," "the enemy [the Union army]
plied pick, and spade, and axe with such silent vigor that
there arose, as if by the touch of the magician's wand, a vast
cordon of redoubts of powerful profile, connected by heavy
infantry parapets, stretching from the Appomattox to the
extreme Federal left,&mdash;a line of prodigious strength, and
constructed with amazing skill, destined long to remain, to
the military student at least, an enduring monument of the
ability of the engineers of the Army of the Potomac."</p>

<p>Siege operations had now fairly commenced on the right,
extending along the line from the Appomattox to the Jerusalem
Plank road, and we had entered upon the daily round of
life which was to continue for the next fifty days,&mdash;the regular
routine of duty in the picket line and the main line,&mdash;a
routine which, in the history of the campaign, can be expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
in the simple, yet significant, phrase, "The Siege of Petersburg."
But in that daily routine there transpired much
that is interesting and painful to the survivors of our regiment,
and the account of our operations during those eventful
days will be embodied in a diary of the siege.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

DIARY OF THE SIEGE.</h2>


<p>The next two days, June 24th and 25th, were passed in
comparative quiet in the woods. We were under arms
nearly all the time, as an attack upon the enemy from our
right was anticipated. The firing on that line, held by the
Eighteenth Corps, was very heavy, but no attack was made.
The heat was intense, and the men in the trenches suffered
greatly. Our diet was somewhat improved by the arrival
of some supplies of ale and porter, with a little ice thrown
in, from the United States Sanitary Commission Depot, which
had just been established at City Point.</p>

<p>On the night of the 25th we were ordered to the front,
and relieved the Ninth New Hampshire in the trenches.
During the night most of the men were busy with the pickaxe
and shovel. We were subjected to a severe artillery
fire all day, and the picket fire was close. Large bodies of
colored troops were at work filling gunny-bags and ammunition-boxes
with sand, to be used on the top of the parapets
for the protection of loop-holes. Private Hezekiah Hall, of
Company I, was severely wounded, and the Adjutant of the
Second New York Rifles, while passing through our line, was
killed. At midnight we relieved the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania
in the picket line, getting fairly into the pits about daylight.
The duty was about the same as when we were there
on the 22d. The line had been made continuous and much
improved. Abatis had been placed in front, and a covered
way continued from the main line. This covered way was
very deep, and protected with high embankments and gabions.
The firing was very constant and the range perfect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Corporal Charles Gilbert, of Company H, and Private
George F. Bradford, of Company B, were wounded, the
former mortally. We had our first experience under the
mortar-firing of the enemy. They fired twenty-four-pound
shells with great precision.</p>

<p>The advanced position which we occupied was but little
more than one hundred yards from that portion of the main
line of the enemy known as the "Elliott salient." The line
occupied by our brigade was directly in front of this work.
In rear of this portion of our line the ground declined suddenly
into a narrow ravine, which widened into a meadow,
which afforded a position for massing troops, and screened
working-parties from the observation of the enemy in the
salient in front. After Colonel Curtin had been wounded in
the attack of the 18th, which secured this position, the command
of the brigade devolved on Lieutenant-Colonel
Pleasants, of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania. Being frequently
on the front line he had observed this ravine, and as
he was by profession a practical civil and mining engineer
it occurred to him that a mine could be successfully excavated
there. He carefully examined the ground, and having
satisfied himself that the work could be accomplished he unfolded
his plan to General Potter, who approved it, and he in
turn conferred with General Burnside, who was much pleased
with the proposal, and ordered that the work should be
commenced.</p>

<p>This was done at noon of the 25th, by Col. Pleasants, with
his own regiment, the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania, which had
been detailed for this purpose. Most of these men were miners
from Schuylkill County, and familiar with such operations.
Colonel Pleasants entered upon the work with great enthusiasm,
although he received but little encouragement outside
the Ninth Corps. Generals Burnside and Potter seemed to
be the only high officers who believed in its success. There
were many discouragements attending its commencement,
as it was ridiculed at army head-quarters. Col. Pleasants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
was denied mining picks, but straightened out army picks.
His instruments were poor and old. He was obliged to make
his surveys and measurements on the front line, exposed to
the fire of the sharp-shooters. He had no wheelbarrows;
but the men nailed strips of boards for handles on old
cracker-boxes, and brought out the earth in these. He
had also to contend with official indifference and coolness; yet
the brave man toiled on with undaunted spirit. As we lay
in our picket pits this 27th day of June we could distinctly
hear our comrades delving beneath us. The earth as it was
brought out was piled up in the ravine, and covered with
fresh bushes to conceal it from the observation of the
enemy. The mortar shells from the enemy's bombs dropped
continually in the ravine around the entrance to the mine,
causing great annoyance to the men, but not interrupting
the work. The day passed without special incident. We
were relieved at night and went back to the woods.</p>

<p>June 28th. We prepared muster-rolls for two months' pay
at our camp in the pine woods. Some of the regiment went
to City Point to obtain from the regimental baggage the
necessary blanks for muster, and met Captain Levi N.
Smith, formerly First Lieutenant of Company D, who was
now forwarding commissary, feeding the entire army of the
Potomac and General Butler's command. He warmly welcomed
his old comrades in arms, and gave expression to his
abiding interest in the regiment. The regimental sutler was
also found at City Point, with a cargo of supplies to be forwarded
to the front as soon as he should be permitted to land.</p>

<p>The next day we relieved the Second Brigade in the
trenches. In placing the pickets, Sergeant C. Henry Moseley,
commanding Company B, was seriously wounded by
being shot through the right hand.</p>

<p>The 30th was passed at the front in the heat and dust.
The firing was very sharp, especially on the right, where
much artillery ammunition was used. Captain Ames was
again slightly wounded in the left hand. He went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
rear to have the wound dressed, and returned immediately
to the front. Effective strength this day, five commissioned
officers, including assistant surgeon and one hundred and
seventy-three enlisted men; total, one hundred and seventy-eight.
Twenty-three were sick in hospital.</p>

<p>July 1st. On duty in the trenches; pickets unusually lively.
They are extremely hostile toward us. On the left, along the
Fifth Corps line, there is no firing by day, and the men from
both armies get water from a spring between the lines.
Here there is no cessation by day or night. It may be
caused by the nearness of our line, the suspicion of a sudden
attack, or because of the presence of colored troops in our
working parties. Our losses are severe, averaging fifteen a
day on our division line. Corporal James H. Barry, of Company
I, a gallant soldier, who was wounded May 6th, was
killed in the trenches to-day by a sharp-shooter. At night
the regiment retired to the woods.</p>

<p>July 2d and 3d. On duty in the rear. Heavy siege guns
were sent to the front to be placed in a new battery to be
built in our line. On the 3d we were mustered for pay.
The line was short, indeed, compared with our last muster, at
Catlett's Station. How many in that brief time have gone
from the toils and pains and hardships of a soldier's life
to sleep in soldiers' graves! How many names are to-day
transferred from the rolls of these companies to the roll of
the honored dead! To-day the Sanitary and Christian Commissions
sent a generous supply of hospital and other stores,
to aid in celebrating the national holiday to-morrow. These
were distributed equally among the companies. The staff of
our national color was shattered by a bullet to-day. Both
staves are now broken, and the flags are riddled with bullet-holes.
They are also stained with the blood of heroes who
have borne them unto death. At dark we relieved the
Second Brigade.</p>

<p>July 4th. Regiment in the trenches. The heat was
intense, and the men pitched their shelter-tents over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
top of the trenches. This kept out the sun, but excluded
also the air. General Burnside and the division commanders
were on the front line together in the afternoon, and the
regimental prophets predicted an immediate attack; but
the hours dragged along, and the day proved to be remarkably
quiet. A request was transmitted to the State authorities
for a new stand of colors. One year ago we commenced the
Jackson campaign, which proved so disastrous to the
regiment. The anniversary was frequently mentioned by
the men. Then we hoped to spend this day in peace at home.
Now we dare not hope for a speedy ending of the war. Then
Gettysburg and Vicksburg encouraged the belief that the
weight of the struggle had passed. Now Atlanta, Petersburg,
and Richmond, bid prolonged defiance. But the end is
coming!</p>

<p>July 5th. Passed without incident. Firing less severe
than usual. The monotony of siege life unbroken. Regiment
relieved at nine in the evening.</p>

<p>July 6th. First Lieutenant Fairbank received his commission
as Captain, <em>vice</em> Warriner, resigned, and was
mustered in. Information was received that all the vacancies
among the commissioned officers have been filled by promotions
from the ranks. This information was received with
pleasure, as it will increase the working-force and efficiency
of the regiment. To-day private H. A. Murdoch, of
Company H, was wounded in the arm.</p>

<p>July 7th. To-day the Fourth Rhode Island arrived from
Yorktown <em>via</em> City Point, and was assigned to our brigade.
Its commander, Colonel W. H. P. Steere, being the senior
officer, assumed command of the brigade. More sanitary
supplies, consisting of twenty-five pounds of white sugar,
a dozen cans of milk, vegetables, a few bottles of sherry,
brandy, etc., were received from the Commissions, and
distributed among the sick. There is much sickness in the
command. The extreme heat, arduous duty, and constant
exposure to danger, are wearing on men who up to this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
have borne all the hardships of the campaign. At night the
regiment relieved the troops in the picket line, in the old
position. The works daily show the labor expended upon
them. They are now very strong, and their condition much
improved. Rumors prevail that an assault is to be made
to-morrow.</p>

<p>July 8th. The duty in the trenches to-day was very
severe, owing to the intense heat, and the sharp, incessant
firing. Our men had good range, and replied to the enemy
shot for shot. Enemy on the alert, and asking about the
mine. They regard it as a great joke, and threaten to
countermine. More rumors of an assault from our front.
Lately our men discovered an ice-house in front of our
line, a little to the left of our position, and for a while it has
been neutral ground for one or two men from the opposing
lines to get ice, to the extent that if any one has been seen
near the ice-house they have not been fired upon. To-day,
however, Corporal Lucius Lowell, of Company F, in endeavoring
to get some ice, was fired upon, and received two
bad wounds in the breast and wrist.</p>

<p>July 9th. Still on duty in the trenches. Intensely hot.
To-day we received the cheering news of the sinking of the
rebel pirate "Alabama" by the United States Steamer
"Kearsarge." This information was received with loud
cheering. The rebels across the way wanted to know the
cause of our joy, and were answered by a double-shotted
salute from all our artillery, which made them burrow for an
hour. At night we were relieved.</p>

<p>July 10th. In the woods, suffering from intense heat, and
tormented by myriads of flies, which were as hostile as the
rebel pickets in our front. Sergeant Thomas H. Haskell,
who was wounded in the right hand at Spottsylvania, and
yesterday, though not fully recovered, returned to duty with
a First Lieutenant's commission, was mustered and assigned
to the command of Company B. Several enlisted men also
returned, and the effective strength at night was one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and ninety; six commissioned officers and one hundred and
eighty-four enlisted men, with fourteen sick in the hospital.</p>

<p>July 11th. The day was very hot, relieved by showers at
night. At nine o'clock the regiment went to the front and
relieved the Seventeenth Vermont on picket. To-day a siege
order was issued from army head-quarters, regulating the
operations of the siege.</p>

<p>July 12th and 13th. Regiment on duty in the trenches.
The firing has been very light, and entirely suspended at
times. For the first time since the opening of the campaign
the enemy has been friendly, even to the extent of sitting
upon the rifle-pits and talking across to our men. Some
have waved papers, and have come half way to our lines to
proffer an exchange. It soon transpired that their object
was to obtain northern papers for intelligence concerning the
rebel invasion of Maryland under General Early, and the destruction
of northern property. Their anxiety was very
great; but we received imperative orders forbidding any
exchange of papers, or holding any communication with the
enemy. Captain Smith fired upon some men of another
regiment who went out to exchange papers, and refused to
obey his orders to return. At night artillery and mortar
firing was resumed. At midnight we were relieved.</p>

<p>July 14th and 15th. In the pine woods. Many rumors in
circulation of an immediate attack to be made from our front.
The work of constructing forts and batteries goes on night
and day. At half-past eight P.M., on the 15th, we relieved
the Seventeenth Vermont in our old position in the trenches.
The night was dark and misty, and the enemy kept up an
incessant firing. Corporal Albert Foskett, Company H, was
wounded and taken to the rear. The sick belonging to the
Ninth Corps were removed to the hospital at City Point,&mdash;a
fact which caused other rumors of attack to be circulated.</p>

<p>July 16th. The regiment was in command of Captain
Ames, as Captain Smith was detailed as division officer of
the trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>July 17th. The regiment was exposed to a very close fire
throughout the day. The mortar shells dropped all around
us, the practice being unusually good. Private Jerry Harrigan,
of Company K, was mortally wounded. The only consolation
while we are under this trying fire is that our practice
is as good as the enemy's.</p>

<p>July 18th. In the woods. Captain Barker, who was
wounded at Cold Harbor, June 3d, returned to duty,
with a commission as Major,&mdash;<em>vice</em> Draper, who has been
commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel,&mdash;and assumed command
of the regiment. Lieutenant Marshall, who was wounded at
the Wilderness, also returned to duty, with a commission as
Captain, and was assigned to Company A. In leaving the
trenches this morning private Leonard A. Chapman, of Company
K, was fired at by a sharp-shooter and instantly killed.</p>

<p>July 19 and 20th. The weather was rainy, rendering the
trenches very uncomfortable. A large fort, called "The Fourteen-Gun
Battery," has been constructed in our division line,
and garrisoned by a regiment of Connecticut Heavy Artillery.</p>

<p>July 21st. Private Martin Maynard, of Company D, was
wounded in the leg and suffered amputation. There has
been no change in our tour of duty. The system has been
reduced to a science; so, also, has been the hostility of the
enemy. Notwithstanding the strong condition of our works,
and the great improvements constantly made, the watchful
sharp-shooters of the enemy have unerring aim upon the
loop-holes, and the least exposure on the part of any of our
men is sure to draw a murderous fire. In the rear we are
out of the range of their sharp-shooters, but exposed to
the chance shots which every moment are sent into the
woods.</p>

<p>July 22d. To-day Captain Morse, who was severely
wounded at Spottsylvania, returned to duty and resumed
command of Company C. Lieutenant Davidson also returned
from the hospital. Private Judson Maynard, of Company H,
was wounded July 23d. The regiment went to the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
at night, and resumed its duty in the trenches. To-day the
mine was completed, and our comrades of the Forty-eighth
Pennsylvania are rejoicing. In spite of obstacles and discouragements
the great work has been successfully accomplished.
The men report that they can distinctly hear the
enemy in the fort over their heads. With proper tools the
work which has consumed four weeks could have been
performed in ten days. Colonel Pleasants received many
congratulations on the success of his undertaking. His report
of his operation is intensely interesting. The main
gallery is five hundred and ten feet long, with two lateral
galleries,&mdash;the left thirty-seven feet, the right thirty-eight
feet in length, averaging about four and one-half feet high
by the same width, and will require eight magazines, four
in each lateral gallery, or about twelve thousand pounds of
powder. Eighteen thousand cubic feet of earth have been
excavated. Whatever may be the result of the explosion,
and the attack which may be made, there can be no doubt
of the great success which has crowned the determined
efforts of Colonel Pleasants and his hard-working regiment.</p>

<p>July 24th. A regiment of colored troops was at work
all day building a new covered way through our camp in
the woods, which necessitated a change of some of our
quarters and bomb-proofs. Captain Smith on duty as
brigade officer of the day. A heavy storm set in and the
rain poured in torrents nearly all the night, and the weather
was very cold. The men were soaked and chilled, and it
was a rough night to stand at a loop-hole and watch. The
sufferings of the troops in the front lines during this siege&mdash;from
hunger, thirst, protracted watching, constant danger,
from burning heat by day and chills by night, from sudden
changes in the temperature that rack the strongest frames,
from the numberless exposures and hardships and privations&mdash;can
never be adequately portrayed. They will live, however,
in the memories of those who endure and survive
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>July 25th. After a very stormy night we were blessed
with a cool, comfortable day. An invigorating breeze soon
dried the mud in the trenches, and restored the buoyant spirits
of the men. This morning private Jesse Gleason, of Company
F, a brave and faithful soldier, was killed by a sharp-shooter,
and was buried in the woods near regimental head-quarters,
where so many of his comrades sleep. Thus, one by one,
they go, just when we need them most. To-day, Colonel
Steere, our brigade commander, went home on account of
sickness and disability, and Colonel Bliss, of the Seventh
Rhode Island, assumed command of the brigade. The regiment
returned to the woods at night. The covered way
through our camp was finished.</p>

<p>July 26th. In the woods all day. Large fatigue parties
at work. Lieutenant Davidson was mustered in, and assigned
to Company G. News was received of a great battle at
Atlanta, and the death of General McPherson.</p>

<p>July 27th. The regiment was marched to the open ground
in rear of the woods, and treated to the luxury of an hour's
battalion drill! The mine was charged with powder, eight
thousand pounds being placed under the rebel fort. General
Burnside asked for a charge of twelve thousand pounds, but
received only eight thousand pounds. Troops put under
orders to be in constant readiness to move. Perhaps our
siege days are nearly ended. The regiment went to the
trenches at night. The weather was rainy and cold.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

THE MINE AFFAIR.</h2>


<p>July 28th. A day of anxiety and suspense. The troops
expected an explosion of the mine, and an assault upon the
enemy's lines. A great force on fatigue duty, carrying out
bags, barrels, gabions, and stakes, and preparing the covered
ways and traverses to facilitate the movements of troops.
During the afternoon three pieces of the Third Vermont
Artillery bombarded a house just inside the rebel works in
our front, and finally demolished it. It was a busy day along
the lines.</p>

<p>July 29th. Another long, anxious day. The regiment
was on duty in the front line. The weather was excessively
hot. The position of the enemy was examined
and our own works were visited by many general and staff
officers, and there were certain indications all around us of an
impending attack. All sorts of rumors prevailed, and various
theories were advanced; but toward night we received positive
information that the mine will be exploded at half-past
three to-morrow morning. The Ninth Corps is to attack as
soon as the explosion occurs. General Meade has overruled
General Burnside's plan of attacking with the colored division,
and ordered him to select one of his white divisions to lead
the assault. The position has been determined by lot, and
fallen to General Ledlie and the First Division. Our men
would be more hopeful of the result had the choice fallen
upon General Potter. Our division is to support the attack.
We are to be relieved in the trenches by colored troops of
the Eighteenth Corps, and form with the division as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
relieved. Toward evening troops were massed in our rear,
filling all the covered ways and passages leading to the front
line. Reserves from other corps filled our camp in the woods.
The troops were under arms all night.</p>

<p>Before daylight on the 30th the regiments on our right
and left had been relieved. Notice was sent two or three
times that no relief had been sent to our regiment, and each
time the order came back to hold the line until relieved. All
our efforts to have the relief on our right and left extend so
as to cover our front having failed, we were obliged to
remain on duty in the pits. Before the sun had reached the
meridian we were satisfied that what we regarded a great
misfortune proved to be our salvation. Colonel Pleasants
was directed to explode the mine at half-past three o'clock
A.M. The First Division was ordered to charge through the
aperture which would be made in the enemy's works and
advance directly to the crest, or Cemetery Hill. The Third
Division was ordered to cover the left. The Second Division
was ordered to advance, if possible, to the right of the
explosion, and to establish a line on the crest of a ravine
running nearly at right angles to the enemy's line, and
protect the right flank from the enemy's attack. At the
appointed hour the fuse was lighted, and all waited in deep
silence for the expected explosion. On account of dampness
the fuse was extinguished, and the valuable time slipped
rapidly away. We all know the story of the brave Lieut.
Doughty and Sergeant Reeves, of the Forty-eighth, who nobly
volunteered to go into the mine to ascertain the cause of
failure to explode. The break in the fuse was found and
relighted. At forty-two minutes past four we witnessed a
volcano and experienced an earthquake. With a tremendous
burst, which shook the hills around, a column of earth shot
upwards to an enormous height, bearing the "Elliot salient,"
its guns and garrison, and making a crater or chasm one
hundred and thirty-five feet long, ninety-seven feet wide, and
more than thirty feet deep. The garrison, consisting of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
hundred and seventy-eight men of the Eighteenth and Twenty-second
South Carolina and Pegram's Petersburg Battery,
were completely buried. Pleasants' work had been terribly
successful. Before the deafening report of the explosion had
subsided more than one hundred pieces of artillery along the
line opened a terrific fire, adding grandeur to the scene. Under
cover of this fire the First Division charged over the intervening
space into the crater, but halted there instead of
moving forward. General Griffin's brigade of our division
began to move almost at once, passing through and into a
portion of the line from which the rebels were driven, and
moved to the right. The smoke and dust were so dense at
this time that nothing could be seen, and the leading
regiments got farther to the left than was intended, coming
thus in contact with some of the troops of the First Division.
The movement was also embarrassed by some of the First
Division moving to the right and huddling in the vacant works
instead of moving forward. When our brigade moved forward
through the covered way, the men became intermixed
with troops of another corps, who were moving out. Still
the main portion kept on its way, crossed the cornfield
and passed into the crater, under a fearful fire of the enemy,
who had now somewhat recovered from the first alarm, and
had returned to man their deserted works.</p>

<p>The troops of the Second Division moved forward as best
they could; but as the First Division had halted, and would
not move forward, it was almost impossible to make any
progress. The ground to the right of the crater was found
to be much cut up with small pits and traverses, which were
now filled by the enemy, who kept up a severe fire from these
as well as from a line of pits on the ravine. Finding that
General Griffin's brigade, which had lost heavily, was being
thrown into confusion by being mixed with the troops of
other divisions, and that the enemy was rallying rapidly,
General Potter directed him to move forward without any
reference to other troops and attack the enemy in front. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
passing his command over and through the troops which
were in confusion Griffin's brigade became much broken up.
The fire by this time was very hot, and it was impossible
to properly re-form his ranks. However, several pits of the
enemy were charged and some ground was gained.</p>

<p>Our brigade commander was ordered to follow on, with
such troops as he had, and closely support and cover the
right flank. He sent forward the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts,
Fourth Rhode Island, and Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, to form
on the right, leaving the Seventh Rhode Island in reserve,
and holding the Second and Fifty-first New York to send
forward if there was room. Finding that he could not get in,
in consequence of the stopping of troops, and the great confusion
caused by a crowd of troops in such limited space, he
was ordered to move a portion of the brigade to the right,
and charge down the enemy's line, and also, at the same time,
to attack the enemy at the ravine. The Fifty-eighth Massachusetts,
Fourth Rhode Island, and Forty-fifth Pennsylvania
were formed to charge down the enemy's line to the right,
and the two New York regiments to attack near the ravine.
This last attack was to instantly follow the first, as soon as
the colors of the leading regiments could be seen moving
forward.</p>

<p>The ground over which the first three regiments was to
charge was an open field, fully in range of the enemy's
musketry and artillery. Just as the troops were moving
forward, the direction of these regiments was changed, in compliance
with a peremptory order from General Burnside to
attack the crest. Accordingly these three regiments charged
directly up the hill toward the battery in the woods. The
charge was a gallant one, under a murderous fire of grape and
canister from the enemy's artillery, which was brought to
bear from every direction; yet the little band kept on, and
the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania had nearly reached the house
on the top of the hill, when the line wavered, and, for want
of support, was obliged to fall back to the covered way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
or ditch leading to the work which had been previously
taken.</p>

<p>While this was being done the two New York regiments
charged the enemy at the ravine: the Second New York on
the right, and the Fifty-first on the left of it, some considerable
distance intervening. The line was carried and some prisoners
captured. The position reached by the Second New York
was within twenty yards of the rebel fort at the old barn. By
this time Griffin's brigade had been extricated from the
terrible confusion near the crater, and had moved forward
slowly, under a hot fire, a step at a time, and the whole of
the Second Division was beyond the enemy's line and to the
right of the exploded fort. As General Potter was re-forming
and connecting his lines preparatory to charging the hill, the
Fourth Division (colored) unexpectedly advanced, and attempted
to pass over the men in the crater, and charge the
enemy's lines through our division. In this they were but
partially successful. General Potter, at the time the colored
division moved out, had the right of his division nearly connected
with the Fifty-first New York, near the ravine, and
partly covered the three regiments which had charged the
hill and fallen back into the covered way. Soon after the
arrival of the colored troops the enemy, with two divisions,
under Generals Mahone and Ransom, made an assault,
when these troops broke and fled in confusion into the crater.
The situation, difficult enough before their arrival, now became
alarming. An indescribable scene of confusion followed.
Colors of our regiments, which had been planted on the parapets,
were thrown down and trampled under foot in the dirt
as the lines came crowding into the crater, or sought shelter
wherever it could be found from the terrible fire that was
poured upon them. White men and colored lay indiscriminately
together.</p>

<p>The enemy's fierce assault was repulsed by our division.
It was, however, immediately renewed, and a desperate hand-to-hand
fight ensued. The brigade fought as men seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
fight. The Forty-fifth Pennsylvania captured a rebel flag,
and Captain Gregg had a personal encounter with a rebel
officer, which made him famous throughout the division.
The color-bearers of the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts were both
wounded and captured. The colors of two other regiments
which had been planted on the parapet were literally torn
to pieces and the staves broken. The losses in killed and
wounded were very great, and more than one hundred prisoners
were captured from the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts
and Forty-fifth Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The fighting up to this time was as desperate as any
during the war. For five long hours of that intensely hot
day the troops of our division had been actively engaged,
exposed to a severe fire of artillery and musketry, which
steadily increased until it became as terrible as any endured
in the campaign. The enemy brought artillery to bear
from every direction, commanding the front and flanks,
sweeping, also, the rear of the line, and commanding all the
approaches, inflicting great damage. The heat was overpowering.
In addition to the killed and wounded more
than two hundred in our division had been prostrated by
heat. Hundreds of men, besides, were so exhausted physically
that it was simply impossible for them to load and
fire. They suffered greatly from thirst, as it was impossible
to obtain any water. The fire from our line had slackened
considerably, while that of the enemy steadily increased.
A steady concentric fire was poured into the crater, and the
horrors of that place cannot be adequately portrayed.</p>

<p>The enemy had been so roughly handled in their assault
after the colored troops had fallen back that they did not
seem inclined to renew it, but kept up a continuous fire at
short range which was very effective. Although it had been
a lost battle since morning, General Potter at noon was
making preparations to connect the line and intrench it,
when he received orders to withdraw his troops at discretion.
But this was a most difficult movement to execute, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
account of the mingled mass of troops in the crater, and an
attempt to retire was to run the gauntlet of almost certain
death. There were some brave spirits there who endeavored
to restore order, and inspire courage to make a stand
to cover the withdrawal. While the troops were retiring
the enemy made a furious assault with a fresh division, in
overwhelming numbers, on the lines about the crater, and
forced the troops holding them to give way and fall back or
surrender. Those escaped who could, and at two o'clock
those remaining in the crater surrendered. Most of the
troops of the Second Division were withdrawn, the last
regiment to retire being the Second New York Rifles, at four
o'clock, two hours after the surrender of the crater.</p>

<p>The loss of the division in the action was nine hundred
and three killed, wounded, and missing, including seventy-five
commissioned officers, out of less than three thousand
rank and file, including two batteries of artillery. The
brigade lost two hundred and seventy-one, which was very
severe, considering the numbers engaged. The Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania lost sixty-eight out of eighty<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> taken into the
fight, and the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts brought out only
twenty-eight muskets out of nearly two hundred engaged.
The losses in the other three regiments engaged were less
severe. The heroic bravery of the brigade was never more
conspicuously displayed than amid the trials of that dreadful
day. "All the officers and men of the command," says
General Potter, in his official report, "fought with the
greatest courage and determination."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The losses of the rebels in their charges upon our lines was no less severe. The
Sixth Virginia carried in ninety-eight men and lost eighty-eight. The Sharp-shooters
carried in eighty men and lost sixty-four, their commander falling, while leaping upon
the parapet, <em>pierced by eleven bayonet wounds</em>. The Forty-first Virginia lost one-fourth
its number; the Sixty-first within a fraction of half its number. The loss in
the Sixteenth was nearly as great as in the Sixth, proportionally. See McCabe's
"Defence of Petersburg," <cite>Southern Historical Society Papers</cite>, Dec., 1876, pp. 293,
294.</p></div>

<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, as the Second New York
Rifles returned from the rebel lines and marched through our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
pits with colors flying high above the top of the pits, our
men told them they had better lower their colors unless they
wanted to draw the enemy's fire and receive a shelling.
They gave no heed to the caution and kept the flags flying.
The words were scarcely uttered before we heard the never-to-be-forgotten
whistle of a mortar shell, and the next instant
it struck squarely in the pits and exploded within three feet
of the colors. None were killed; but one of the Second
New York had a hand blown off, and one of our men had his
face filled with the hard dirt from the bottom of the pits.
The shot had the effect to bring down the flags to a trail, and
the regiment, with bowed heads, passed out of the pits.</p>

<p>That evening the remnant of the brigade resumed its position
in the trenches, and picket-firing was renewed. During
the evening Private J. Wesley Packard, of Company B, was
shot in the head and instantly killed while standing as sentinel
at a loop-hole from which he had fired several shots which
attracted the attention of the sharp-shooters. He had returned
from the General Hospital only three days before, had
picked up a musket and equipments in the rear, and this was
his first day's duty in the trenches. Private J. L. Walker,
of Company E, was badly wounded in the thigh.</p>

<p>Thus ended a day which proved to be the saddest in the
history of the Ninth Corps. Its total loss was three thousand
eight hundred and twenty-eight men. We have not attempted
to describe the action, or even to give a complete narrative
of the part taken by our own division. The action has been
the subject of investigation and discussion by Congressional
Committees, Military Courts, historians, and critics. Hundreds
of pages of testimony and reports have been printed.
Wide differences of opinion have existed, and still exist. It
is no part of our duty to attempt to reconcile these differences,
but only to record our part in the great drama, and
leave to future historians the task of weighing arguments and
the incidents of that dreadful day, and the responsibility of
awarding praise and censure. Of one fact, however, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
be certain. Other troops than the white divisions of the
Ninth Corps should have been selected to enter the breach
and make the assault. Not that these were wanting in courage
and devotion to the cause. The record of their bravery
from the Rapidan to Petersburg is unsurpassed in the annals
of that campaign; but from the commencement of the siege
they had become much worn down by constant labors in the
trenches, under an almost incessant fire for a period of forty
days, in which they lost on the average one man in eight.
During all these days, from a distance of less than two hundred
yards, they had surveyed the powerful works of the
enemy becoming stronger and stronger by day and by night.
The fire of the rebel sharp-shooters had been so close and
unerring that no portion of the body could be for a moment
exposed without drawing the deadly bullet. The labor under
a broiling midsummer sun had been most exhaustive. Many
of the men were enfeebled by disease, all were weakened by
confinement, and the experiences of such a life as we had led
for six weeks, had, in a measure, weakened the vigor and
spirit of all. It was General Burnside's plan to assault with
the colored division, which had been drilled for weeks for that
special purpose. They were fresh, and had taken but little
part in the campaign. The fighting at Petersburg on the
15th of June by the colored troops of the Eighteenth Corps
had aroused a spirit of emulation, and they were anxious for
the opportunity of taking part in the campaign. Many who
saw their advance on the 30th were satisfied that, if they had
been permitted to lead the assault, they would have secured
the crest of Cemetery Hill, and achieved a brilliant victory.
Such was the opinion of the lieutenant-general before the
Committee on the Conduct of the War.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

THE SIEGE CONTINUED.</h2>


<p>After the Battle of the Crater, the brigade settled down
to the former round of siege duty. On the morning of the
31st the regiment mustered for duty twelve commissioned
officers, and one hundred and seventy-nine enlisted men. It
was a day of sadness throughout the corps. The intense heat
continued. The dead in front of our lines resembled a heavy
skirmish line lain down to rest. A flag of truce was sent
out several times to endeavor to obtain a brief armistice for the
removal of the wounded and the burial of the dead; but all
efforts were unavailing. The enemy was busy repairing his
demolished works, and hundreds of our brave men found a
grave in the crater, where the concentric fire of the enemy had
been most deadly. Among this number was the brave and
gallant Major Prescott, of the Fifty-seventh Massachusetts,
formerly captain of our Company B. Major Barker was on
duty as brigade officer of the day. Dr. Bryant was detailed
for service at the Fourth Division Hospital, to assist Dr.
Prince in caring for the hundreds of wounded of that division.
At eleven o'clock that night, after four days' incessant duty
in the trenches, the regiment was relieved and returned to
the pine woods. The monthly return of the regiment made
that day bore upon the rolls as the total strength, present
and absent, five hundred and thirty-two,&mdash;a decrease, from all
causes, of four hundred and four men since the 31st of May,
when we numbered, present and absent, nine hundred and
thirty-six.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>August 1st. A truce of several hours' duration prevailed
along our front, and the dead between the lines were buried
and all the wounded were removed. The regimental sutler
arrived with a large stock of goods. Lieutenant Davidson
was mustered as Captain and assigned to Company G. The
weather continued intensely hot.</p>

<p>August 2d. The heavy siege guns were removed from
the batteries to-day. The firing continued incessantly on
the front line. A thunder-shower tempered the heat.</p>

<p>August 3d. We were aroused at three o'clock, and
waited a long time in line, ready to move at a moment's
warning. A rebel attack was anticipated, but their line did
not advance. By way of exercise we had a battalion drill in
the open field from eight to nine, and found it hot work.
To-day all the vacancies in non-commissioned officers were
filled by appointment and the warrants were issued. At
eight o'clock the regiment went to the trenches. The firing
all night was unusually severe, the enemy being more hostile
than ever since the explosion of the mine.</p>

<p>August 4th. A day of fasting and prayer throughout the
northern States, by proclamation of the President. By order
of General Meade all unnecessary work was suspended. But
the work of death was not suspended. Private Thomas
Oakes, of Company A, was shot through the head while on
duty at a loop-hole, and died in a few moments. He was a
brave soldier, and always at his post.</p>

<p>August 5th. The intense heat continued, and the last day
has recalled vividly the hot temperature of Mississippi, which
we were enduring one year ago. In the afternoon one of our
mortar shells exploded a magazine in the enemy's fort near
the railroad, causing great commotion in Rebeldom. They
immediately opened with musketry and artillery, making a
great noise, which continued for a long time, but their firing
gradually settled down into an ordinary picket fire. The
regiment was relieved at night.</p>

<p>August 6th and 7th. Regiment in the woods. The troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
electrified with the news of Farragut's great victory in Mobile
Bay. Heavy artillery, and mortar firing.</p>

<p>August 8th. Regiment on duty in the trenches. Major
Barker division officer of the trenches. Our head-quarter
baggage was sent to City Point. Private Henry Russell,
Company D, was mortally wounded by a shot in the head
while at his post of duty. Our artillery practice to-day
was very effective, and a great fire was seen inside the rebel
lines near sundown, caused probably by the explosion of some
of our shells. The Seventh Maine Battery is now used as a
mortar battery, and its practice is very effective. The rebel
picket fire during the entire night was uncomfortably hot.</p>

<p>August 9th. On duty in the trenches. Seventeen boxes
of good things arrived from home, for men in our regiment.
At half-past seven P.M. Lieutenant-Colonel Draper arrived
in camp, and upon the return of the regiment from the picket-line
assumed command. He had been absent since May 6th,
and had recovered from the severe wound received that day
in the first charge in the Wilderness. He received a soldier's
welcome from the remnant of the gallant regiment he that
day commanded. A smart thunder-shower at night cooled
the heated atmosphere, and afforded great relief. Rumors
are afloat that we are soon to be relieved in this position by
another corps. Private Henry E. Graves, of Company K,
while on duty at a loop-hole, was badly wounded in the eye
by the explosion of his musket.</p>

<p>August 10th. Our effective strength this morning was
twelve commissioned officers, one hundred and sixty-two enlisted
men; total, one hundred and seventy-four, with twenty
sick in hospital. Lieutenant-Colonel Draper and Major Barker
were mustered in on their new commissions. A court of inquiry
is to investigate the circumstances attending the disaster
of July 30th, and we shall probably get the "facts." Corporal
Fred L. Perry, of Company E, was dangerously shot
in the right arm, and narrowly escaped bleeding to death.
He will have to suffer amputation at the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>August 11th. The victories of Admiral Farragut at
Mobile confirmed, and the intelligence was passed to the
enemy in a double-shotted salute. The regiment went to the
front at night. Large fatigue parties at work, constructing
new and powerful works on the hill between the woods and
the picket. Great quantities of lumber, gabions, poles, and
building material, were hauled up at night, and the work
was pushed rapidly. The enemy's rifles command this crest,
and they made music all night.</p>

<p>August 12th. On duty in the trenches. The enemy
opened from a new battery on Cemetery Hill, the shells from
which reach corps head-quarters. Much artillery was moved
from the works on our left to the rear, and aided to put in
circulation a rumor of a new movement toward Richmond.</p>

<p>August 13th. Very heavy cannonading was heard on the
right, from General Butler's front, across the James. The
Second Corps went over last night, and there are indications
of a heavy movement. Our men were under arms and ready.
It was a happy day in our camp, on account of the arrival
of the paymaster with four months' pay.</p>

<p>August 14th. On duty in the trenches. For the past
fortnight the weather has been intensely hot and dry, and to-day
is no exception. Charles H. Wheeler, of Company I,
wounded in the shoulder. Exposed to severe thundershowers
in the afternoon. General Burnside relinquished the
command of the Ninth Corps, and with his personal staff
left for Washington, leaving General Willcox in command.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
The corps under orders to be ready to move at a moment's
notice. At half-past nine our line was relieved by troops
of the Eighteenth Corps, and the regiment moved back to
the woods in the midst of a pouring rain. At half-past
eleven the regiment was aroused and under arms, and at one
o'clock on the morning of Monday, August 15th, we left our
camp in the woods and moved to the rear. Upon reaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>the open plain we marched toward the left, and it was reported
that we were to support an assault to be made by the
Fifth Corps. The night was black as ink, and as we floundered
about in the darkness among the stumps we soon lost
all traces of the road, and continued moving to the left and
rear until daylight revealed our position. We then countermarched
to General Warren's head-quarters. The Fifth Corps
was quietly withdrawn soon after daylight, and their lines
occupied by our corps.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> General Willcox was soon relieved by Major-General John G. Parke, who was
assigned to the command of the corps.</p></div>

<p>Our brigade relieved the Third Brigade, First Division,
Fifth Corps, and our regiment took possession of the splendid
line of works occupied by the One hundred and eighteenth
Pennsylvania. The works were bomb-proof, and the camp
regular and perfectly clean, reminding us of the camp of the
Seventeenth regulars, at Catlett's Station. The enemy was
found to be comparatively peaceful here. There was no firing
whatever during the day, and our pickets were relieved by
daylight without any molestation. The "Johnnies" were
plainly seen walking about within their lines with impunity,
and the regiment we relieved informed us that the utmost
harmony and good-feeling prevailed on the picket line. To
us who for sixty days had been exposed to an incessant and
hostile fire it was a great relief to be able to stand upright
without the certainty of being shot. The enemy, however,
had frequently opened upon the main line with artillery,
and to resist the fire the main works had been strengthened
and elaborated to the perfection of field fortifications. During
the afternoon and evening the rain came down in a deluge,
filling the bomb-proofs and trenches, inundating the camp,
and making everybody generally miserable. The Fifth Corps,
after being relieved, concentrated for a movement to the left,
to be supported by the First and Third Divisions of our corps,
which were in reserve.</p>

<p>Our little regiment, which could ill afford depletion, had lost
while in the trenches on the right, from the 20th of June to
the 14th of August, seven men killed or mortally wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and eighteen wounded; a total of twenty-five,&mdash;a slow but
sure wasting of some of the most valuable material of which
the regiment could boast.</p>

<p>August 16th. The weather continued rainy and uncomfortable.
Not a shot was fired on our line. Dr. Bryant to-day
received a fully earned and well-deserved promotion, and was
commissioned Surgeon of the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts Volunteers.
There is, however, some doubt as to his being able
to muster in on account of the greatly reduced numbers of
that regiment, it being below the minimum, and having two
assistant surgeons. It will be a calamity to lose the services
of Dr. Bryant. During the entire campaign he has been at
his post, and his duties have been very arduous and unremitting,
from the fact that he has been the only medical officer
with the regiment. He has remained constantly with the
regiment, always in close proximity during an advance, and
ready and willing to perform any duty in the camp or on the
field.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> For the reason given above Dr. Bryant was not able to muster in on his commission
as Surgeon of the Fifty-eighth, and remained with the Thirty-sixth until the close
of the war.</p></div>

<p>August 17th. A day of frequent heavy showers, settling
at night into a cold storm, making the ground soft and miry.
It was a day of comparative quiet, but we had a heavy force
on picket. A vigorous movement is in progress on the right,
and the cannonading throughout the day was severe. General
Hancock has crossed the James with the Second and
Tenth Corps, and a division of cavalry, and has had a spirited
engagement.</p>

<p>August 18th. The day was quiet within the lines, with
rain at short intervals and heavy showers at times. The
trenches and bomb-proofs were very uncomfortable, and required
much baling out to keep the water down. General
Lee having sent a considerable force from his lines to resist
General Hancock's advance north of the James, advantage
was taken of his movement to send General Warren and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the Fifth Corps to the left, to extend that flank across the
Weldon Railroad, about three or four miles distant. General
Warren reached the railroad early in the forenoon, and while
moving toward Petersburg was met by the enemy, and a
fierce battle ensued, attended with considerable loss to the
Fifth Corps; but the railroad was secured and held, and at
nightfall General Warren established his line across it.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock that evening we were ordered to prepare
three days' cooked rations, and be ready to move at daylight.
The meaning of that order was well understood. During the
night the enemy seemed to be aware of some unusual movement
in our lines, and subjected us to a very severe artillery
fire, which was general along the entire line.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the 19th we were relieved by Mott's division
of the Second Corps, which had just recrossed the
James, and the division moved to the left, following the other
two divisions of our corps, which had been ordered to reinforce
General Warren. We were exposed to a hot fire while
leaving the pits, but none in the Thirty-sixth were injured.
The rain poured in torrents nearly all day, and the men were
thoroughly drenched. The route was circuitous, and we
marched nearly six miles over very bad roads. As we neared
the lines, the artillery and musketry fire of the troops in our
front indicated that a heavy battle was in progress. The
division of the enemy which General Warren encountered
yesterday had been heavily reinforced, and had broken through
the skirmish line, extending from the right of the Fifth Corps
toward the left of the main line of works in front of Petersburg,
with a heavy column, and turned Warren's right flank,
causing great confusion and heavy loss, especially in prisoners.
In the midst of this exciting battle the First and Third
Divisions of our corps reached the ground at a most critical
moment, and, forming hastily on General Warren's right,
pushed rapidly forward with the troops of the Fifth Corps,
and drove the enemy in great confusion to his intrenchments.
The fighting was desperate and bloody. The rebel troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
consisted, among others, of Mahone's division of A. P. Hill's
corps.</p>

<p>In the rapid advance of our lines a gap was created
between the Ninth and Fifth Corps, and our division was at
once deployed to fill it. We formed in a clearing and pushed
forward into the woods for about a quarter of a mile, and
went into position across a wood road. In less than ten
minutes we had a good protection of logs; but were not
allowed to remain long in possession, the brigade being
ordered to deploy as skirmishers. The Thirty-sixth first
formed on the left of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, but were
soon filed to the extreme right, when, by General Potter's
order, we were at once returned to our original position on
the left of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, near the wood road.
Captain Raymond, of the brigade staff, was sent by General
Potter down this road to reconnoitre. In a few moments
he rode into a large party of the enemy's skirmishers, and
narrowly escaped capture. His orderly was killed, and as he
attempted to return to the line the pursuit was so close that
several of the enemy were captured. It was an exciting
event, and proved that the enemy was in force in our front.
Owing to the marching and countermarching in deploying,
it was nearly dusk before the line was fairly established.
General Potter ordered an advance, but upon moving forward
it was discovered that we had broken connection with the
First Division on our left, and were obliged to extend in that
direction. Accordingly the Fifty-first New York was deployed
between us and the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania. Owing
to the storm, the darkness, and the low, dense undergrowth,
we were unable to advance beyond a short distance, and
remained through the night in this position, widely deployed
in the dense wood, without intrenchments or fires. The
storm was quite severe, the rain fell in torrents, and the
ground was soaked with water. It proved to be one of
those cheerless, dismal nights, of which we had experienced
so many during the eventful campaign,&mdash;nights the recol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>lection
of which causes a shudder, even after the flight
of years.</p>

<p>The first glimmer of daylight found the line of battle ready
to advance; but no trace of the enemy could be discovered.
Company D, the Color Guard, and Pioneers were formed as
a reserve under charge of the Adjutant, and ordered to
support the centre and keep well up to the skirmish line in
the advance. At half-past eight o'clock the order was given
"Forward! Guide Left!" The dense undergrowth rendered
it very difficult to maintain a good line, as the regiment
covered considerable ground. After advancing about three
hundred yards we reached a cornfield about one hundred
yards wide, with woods beyond. We moved across this
field and halted in the edge of the forest, and connected our
left with the right of the First Division. We were then
ordered to build a line of breastworks. We had just completed
a fine line of works, and were eating our dinner of
roasted corn, gathered from the cornfield, when we were
ordered to the left to reinforce that portion of the line, as an
attack was anticipated. We accordingly moved a distance
of about a hundred yards to the left, to that portion of the
line which had been held by the Second New York Rifles,
which had moved further down. Although they had occupied
the position two hours, not a tree had been cut, and no
protection whatever had been secured. Our men went to
work with a will and soon had a good line of breastworks.
We had just nicely settled down for the second time when
the Adjutant-General came up at a gallop to order the
regiment to extend to the right, as the enemy was threatening
the extreme right, and it had been found necessary to extend
in that direction. We moved back to the first line of
breastworks we had built, not a little angry at being obliged
to build intrenchments for the Second New York.</p>

<p>The portion of line we now occupied was the scene of the
fearful struggle the previous day, when the charging enemy,
under Mahone, encountered the advance of our troops under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
General Willcox. Both lines were charging and met at short
range, when a desperate fight ensued, in which the enemy was
obliged to retire. His dead lay thickly all about us, and the
ground bore evidence of the heavy loss sustained by the
enemy at this point.</p>

<p>The men were under arms all the afternoon, expecting an
attack. There was sharp musketry both on our right and left,
but no unusual disturbance along our front. During the
evening Lieutenant-Colonel Draper was temporarily in command
of the brigade, in consequence of the absence of Colonel
Bliss. At nightfall Captain Hodgkins, acting Adjutant,
was detailed upon the staff of General Ferrero, and Lieutenant
Haskell, of Company B, was assigned to duty as Adjutant
and entered at once upon this service. The tri-monthly report
of this date showed the effective strength to be thirteen commissioned
officers and one hundred and seventy-six enlisted
men; total, one hundred and eighty-nine, with four commissioned
officers and ninety-five enlisted men on extra or
special duty with the corps.</p>

<p>The movement for the possession of the Weldon Railroad,
although attended with heavy losses, had thus far been successful.
General Warren's line was now firmly across the
railroad, and the position strongly fortified. Our corps was
on his right flank, covering much ground between him and
the main line of works; a large cavalry force guarded the
flanks, and artillery had been put in position to repel any
attack the enemy might be disposed to make. It was felt
that another attempt would be made by the rebels to drive
out or break our line. The night shut in cold, dark, and
rainy. The men were under arms, prepared for any emergency.</p>

<p>Early the next morning there were indications of another
attack, and the enemy soon renewed his efforts to regain the
railroad. A heavy cannonading from thirty pieces of artillery,
which crossed their fire over Warren's position, was kept
up for an hour, when a desperate assault was made by Hay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>good's
South Carolina brigade, on the extreme left, with the
intention of turning that flank while a heavy attack was made
in front. The charge was made with great vigor, but was
handsomely repulsed, with heavy loss in killed and wounded.
Five hundred prisoners and three battle-flags were captured,
with comparatively little loss to the Fifth Corps. The attempt
was not renewed, but the enemy retired to his works,
and our line was so strengthened as to render any further
attack a matter of little probability.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

IN THE PINES.</h2>


<p>The excitement and activity caused by the successful operations
at the Weldon Railroad subsided in a great degree by
the 22d, the enemy having abandoned the futile task of striving
to regain his lost ground, and we were left in quiet and
complete possession of this important line of communication.
The regiment was leisurely employed during the day in
strengthening the intrenchments, and skirmishers were advanced
for half a mile or more into the wooded swamp in
its front, but without developing the rebel position.</p>

<p>On the 23d the whole division line was drawn back a short
distance, and works of a more permanent character than those
first thrown up were begun.</p>

<p>The camp sheltered by these defences became known as
that "In the Pines," and deserves more than passing notice.
The Ninth Corps now held that part of the line which
extended from the right of the Fifth Corps on the Weldon
Railroad to the left of the Second Corps, near the Jerusalem
Plank road,&mdash;a distance of about four miles. At the point
occupied by the regiment the line ran along the edge of a belt
of pine timber fronting an open field of varying width, which
separated it from a deep, swampy forest, the trees in the border
of which were felled at random, forming with their prostrate
trunks and interlacing branches that formidable barrier
known as a "slashing." Through this maze were narrow
winding paths for the passage of the pickets who were posted
in the standing timber beyond. The breastworks were
higher than was customary, the earth being thrown up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the front, leaving a ditch, just outside of which was planted
a bristling abatis. Well-built earthworks for artillery were
thrown up at available points, the open ground in front of
the regiment being swept by an enfilading fire from two.
An observer standing upon the works in front of the tents
of the Thirty-sixth commanded a far-reaching view of the
defences, which, as they stretched away on either hand until
hidden by the trees, presented one of the best specimens of
entrenchment to be seen on that wonderful line, which extended
for more than thirty miles, and which, with the opposing
works of the enemy, nearly as long, made the greatest
achievement in field fortification the world ever saw.</p>

<p>This position was held by the regiment from August 23d
until September 25th; and relieved from the harassing duty
in the trenches to which we had been so long subjected, and
confident in the security of our defences, we joyfully improved
a period of needed and grateful rest.</p>

<p>The regimental camp was laid out in an orderly manner,
the absence of underbrush and large size of the pine growth
giving it the appearance of a picnic grove, and was in striking
contrast to the dusty and sun-scorched quarters it had
frequently been our lot to occupy.</p>

<p>The weather, although cool at times, was generally delightful,
and the duties were light. Beyond the regular details
for picket and police, and an occasional bloodless reconnoissance,
there was little call for service, and the men at
their leisure washed and mended their war-worn garments,
and dealt out long-deferred vengeance to predatory vermin;
guns were cleaned, and brasses polished; barbers' chairs of
marvellous construction, attended by thrifty veterans, were
well patronized; long-absent sutlers returned with their
wagons groaning beneath heavy burdens; in short, we were
once more "in camp."</p>

<p>The terrible losses sustained by the Ninth Corps during
the bloody campaign of the summer had sadly thinned its
once crowded ranks. Regiments, that in April marched from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Annapolis in all the pride and confidence which strength inspires,
now mustered around their tattered colors meagre
and skeleton battalions. The loss in commissioned officers
was especially large, and the need of a reorganization of the
corps was painfully apparent. In furtherance of this object
General White, commanding the First Division, was relieved,
by orders dated September 1, and the regiments composing
that division were transferred to the Second and Third Divisions.
On the 13th of September the designation of the several
divisions of the corps was changed as follows: the Third
to be First, under command of Brigadier-General O. B. Willcox;
the Second to remain unchanged, under command of
Brigadier-General R. B. Potter; the Fourth (colored) to be
the Third, under command of Brigadier-General Edward
Ferrero. The corps was under the command of Major-General
John G. Parke.</p>

<p>This change strengthened our brigade by the addition of
the Twenty-first (now a battalion) and Thirty-fifth Regiments
Massachusetts Volunteers.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the regiments composing the
brigade after the reorganization, with the number (commissioned
officers and enlisted men) present for duty in the latter
part of September:&mdash;</p>

<p>Soon after its arrival at the pines the Thirty-fifth Massachusetts
received over three hundred and fifty recruits, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
made up of substitutes from Germany. The camp of these exiles
was near that of the Thirty-sixth, and their ignorance of
the language and queer foreign manners caused an amused
interest in them; but when at night, as became their custom,
they gathered around the camp-fires, and, in an isolation almost
pathetic, sung the songs of <i lang="de">Faderland</i>, the effect was striking,
and we could not but listen with feelings of sympathy
and sadness as the grand old chorals resounded through the
solemn pines.</p>

<p>September 14th, First Lieutenant Henry S. Burrage, who
was wounded at the battle of Cold Harbor, returned to the
regiment, and was mustered in as Captain of Company D.</p>

<p>During this peaceful month the ornamental duties of a soldier
assumed prominence, and the frequent sharp command
"Fall in!" became more suggestive of a drill and dress-parade
than of hurried march or wearisome watch in the trenches.
On the 15th the regiment paraded for brigade inspection, and
on the 21st participated in a review of the brigade by General
Potter, presenting on both occasions a steady and soldierly
appearance that cast no discredit on its past record.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Draper, as President, and Captain
Smith, as Judge-Advocate, of a court martial convened at
division head-quarters, gave attention to the trial of deserters,
most of the cases being those of either ignorant foreign substitutes
or unscrupulous bounty-jumpers.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th the prevailing quiet was broken
by the unusual sound of firing in our front, followed by the
hasty falling back of a portion of the picket line. The breastworks
were hurriedly manned in anticipation of an assault;
but after some desultory firing the enemy prudently withdrew,
evidently satisfied as to the strength of our position,
for no further attempt was made to disturb the line at this
point. In the forenoon of September 25th the Third Division
was reviewed, and a large number of interested spectators
from our regiment were in attendance, criticising with veteran
keenness the military bearing of the "colored troops."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>But the easy life in which the luxury of idleness was
broken only by the routine of camp duty was to be rudely
ended; the friendly shelter which for a while we had enjoyed
was to be exchanged for the deadly exposure of the
battle-field. It was our last day "in the Pines."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

THE ACTION AT PEGRAM FARM.</h2>


<p>On the afternoon of September 25th, about five o'clock,
orders to move were suddenly received, and immediately the
quiet camp became a scene of bustling activity. Tents were
hastily stripped from their poles, knapsacks packed in a
hurry, and in half an hour, having been relieved by the Fifth
Corps, we left our camp. After moving some four miles to
the right a halt was ordered about nine o'clock, and the regiment
bivouacked in the woods in the rear of the Second
Corps.</p>

<p>On the following day tents were pitched, and the men remained
idle in camp, the air thick with rumors, until the
morning of the 28th, when the brigade marched to the
"Gurley House," half a mile from "Yellow Tavern," "in
such a manner that the enemy would notice the movement,"
to quote from the order received from regimental head-quarters.</p>

<p>The 29th was passed in feverish uncertainty, a move being
expected at any moment. Staff officers and orderlies were
riding to and fro, and cavalry in force moved toward the
left; but the regiment did not leave its position. At night
the excitement was heightened by the reading of a despatch
from General Grant, announcing that the railroad between
Petersburg and Richmond had been taken by General Ord,
and that General Birney had defeated the enemy north of
the James.</p>

<p>The morning of September 30th dawned upon a day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
perfect autumnal beauty; but the balmy air, fragrant with the
scent of the pines, the clear sunlight, and cloudless sky left
little impress of their loveliness upon the minds of men who,
after the broken slumbers of the night, were early astir preparing
for battle.</p>

<p>The expected advance began about nine o'clock, the
troops passing over the works of the Fifth Corps on the extreme
left, and into the debatable land beyond. The column
consisted of Ayer's and Griffin's divisions of the Fifth Corps,
followed by Potter's and Willcox's divisions of the Ninth
Corps. We followed the road through woods for about
a mile, when a small country meeting-house, known as Poplar
Spring Church, was reached. There our brigade line of
battle formed at right angles to the road. Meanwhile
the advance of the Fifth Corps had developed near the Peebles
house, an outlying fortification of the enemy, consisting of a
redoubt and flanking rifle-pits, upon which an assault was
made, about ten o'clock, by Griffin's division, and easily
carried, with trifling loss. The enemy, not having sufficient
strength to resist after the loss of his entrenchments, promptly
retreated to his main line, leaving about fifty prisoners and a
piece of artillery in our hands.</p>

<p>The divisions of the Ninth Corps were now ordered to
the front, and immediately advanced, passing the troops of
the Fifth Corps, who were quietly resting with stacked arms
near the captured redoubt.</p>

<p>The regiment moved forward in brigade line of battle in
excellent form, and a rapid advance on the enemy's main
line was anticipated; but, soon after passing the Peebles
house, a halt was ordered, and the movement came to a
complete stand-still.</p>

<p>For three or four hours this fatal and inexplicable delay
continued, although it was evident that the advantage of a
surprise was thus being thrown away, as the enemy must
necessarily have been warned of our presence by the men
who had withdrawn from the redoubt. At last, about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
middle of the afternoon, the impatient and well-nigh disgusted
soldiers were again ordered forward.</p>

<p>Our regiment moved by the flank toward the Boisseau
house,&mdash;an abandoned dwelling that became prominent during
the operations of the ensuing days,&mdash;gathering, in wayside
gossip with adventurous sharp-shooters who had been looking
after an opportunity for fancy shooting at the front, the
cheering news that the rebel works, toward which we were
advancing, had been strongly reinforced during our long
halt. About five o'clock the Second Brigade, General
Griffin, which was pushing forward on our right, slightly in
advance, became engaged with the enemy's skirmish line,
and General Curtin was ordered to make connection with
that command. This was immediately done, our brigade
forming in two lines of battle, as follows: Thirty-fifth
Massachusetts, Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, Fifty-eighth Massachusetts,
and Fifty-first New York, in the first line;
Forty-eighth Pennsylvania, Twenty-first Massachusetts, and
Thirty-sixth Massachusetts, in the second, though extending
further to the left than the first line. The Seventh Rhode
Island were in the rear with entrenching tools, and the
Fourth Rhode Island acted as provost guard, their term of
service having nearly expired.</p>

<p>By this formation the Thirty-sixth came into position on
the extreme left of the brigade, and halted for a few
moments near the Boisseau house, at a fence running along
a sorghum field. Captain Burrage, with the skirmishers of
the regiment, covered the front and left of the regiment,
the line extending from the woods to the Boisseau house.
The firing on our right now increased as the Second Brigade
became hotly engaged, and our line was ordered over the
fence, which was hastily crossed, and an advance of a few
yards made into an open field, which extended a long distance
to the right, exposing to view a large part of the brigade
line of battle, while the enemy was concealed in the woods
beyond. Here the regiment first met the whizzing rebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
bullets, which became so troublesome as to cause the men
to lie down; and, although the prostrate attitude was eminently
adapted to the situation, the recumbent warriors
may have been shamed, and were certainly encouraged, by
the example of General Curtin, who at this juncture reached
the front, and, followed by a single orderly, rode along the
line of his brigade, as coolly as if on review. His horse
was soon after shot under him, and a valuable saddle, sent
as a present from his friends in Pennsylvania, fell into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>We momentarily expected an order to charge, but found
that the situation was changing on the right, to which attention
was drawn from the fact that at that point the line seemed
to be falling back, which soon proved to be the case. Our
regimental line stood inactive, no special pressure being
brought to bear by the enemy in our front, until the retrograde
movement became communicated to the regiment on
our right, when we realized that the rebels, tired perhaps of
waiting for our assault, had boldly sallied from their works
and, sheltered by the surrounding wood, had successfully
flanked our line.</p>

<p>As the whole force covering our right vanished, the
regiment was subjected to a galling fire from that direction
as well as the front. Colonel Draper then ordered a change
of front, but seeing that the enemy's movement threatened to
cut us off from our forces in the rear he changed the order to
a movement by the left flank in the same direction.</p>

<p>The sorghum before mentioned save us a slight shelter, and
we hurriedly made our way through it, the vicious "zip" of
the rebel bullets giving us an incentive to haste. Reaching
the ravine between the Boisseau house and the sorghum field
we found remnants of several regiments of the First Division,
which had fallen into disorder, still gallantly holding
their ground, gathered in little groups around their colors.
Here a stubborn stand was made, and the chief conflict of
the day on the part of our regiment was fought. Many acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of individual gallantry might be mentioned, the officers, and
in some noticeable instances the enlisted men, doing brave
and serviceable work in rallying the scattered squads and
endeavoring to check the advance of the enemy. But the
force was unequal to the task, the Thirty-sixth being the
only regiment that retained its organization; and the position
soon became extremely critical.</p>

<p>A line of the enemy's skirmishers now appeared at the
mouth of the ravine, on our left flank, and coolly picked off
our men without opposition, our fire being mainly directed
at the greater body of the rebel force, which had meanwhile
pressed well around to our right, having cut off and captured
a part of our brigade and driven back the remainder. The
regiment could hold its ground but a short time under the
demoralizing effect of a sharp fire from three sides, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Draper, seeing that further resistance would be
useless sacrifice, seized the colors, against the protest of Color-Sergeant
Rawson, and gave the order to retire.</p>

<p>A lively scattering over the fences and through the grounds
of the Boisseau house ensued, each man doing his level best
to preserve a life for future usefulness to his country, and
little breath was taken until the shelter of a reserve line and
a section of Roemer's battery was secured. Here General
Potter was found sitting gloomily on his horse, to whom Colonel
Draper reported with fifty-two men of our regiment and
twenty men of the Fifty-sixth Massachusetts as "the remains
of his division." The men of the Fifth Corps and that part
of the Ninth held in reserve had by this time been so disposed
as to check any further advance of the enemy, and the battle
ceased as darkness came on. The remnant of our regiment
proceeded to the new line, which was found with difficulty in
the dark, and remained for a short time in position at the
edge of a piece of woods, picking up occasional stragglers.</p>

<p>During the evening we were ordered back to the line of
works taken by the Fifth Corps in the morning, where we
were soon joined by a detachment of about sixty men, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Captains Ames and Morse, which became separated from the
colors in the retreat. As each party had for a time good
reason for supposing the other to be in the hands of the
enemy, the reunion was a joyful one. At roll-call the regiment
mustered one hundred and forty-three men, the largest
number by far of any regiment in the division, although
some had three times that number in the ranks before going
into action. The casualties in the Thirty-sixth were four
killed, sixteen wounded, and sixteen missing,&mdash;a surprisingly
small number in view of the perilous position in which the
regiment was placed. The killed were Corporal Robert F.
Webb, Company A, Privates Lyman H. Gilbert, Company
E, Rufus H. Carter, Company I, and Belthezar Margenot,
Company K,&mdash;the last two being transferred men from the
Twenty-first Regiment. Sergeant Lucius L. Merrick, Company
E, who rejoined the regiment the night before, was mortally
wounded and died ten days later. Merrick was known
throughout the regiment, and respected by all for his manly
Christian character. He was a graduate of Amherst College,
and at the time of his enlistment was preparing for the ministry.
He had been twice wounded, at Knoxville and in the Wilderness,
and was about to receive a commission in a regiment
of colored troops. He was one of the best soldiers in the
regiment, and his death caused sincere grief. Sergeant
Charles Underwood, of Company D, was wounded in the
knee near the Boisseau house, and fell into the hands of the
enemy. His leg was amputated, and in a short time he was
sent through to our lines. A second and third amputation
followed a year or two later, and he died. Sergeant-Major
Washburn was shot through the face, receiving a very severe
wound, and Captain J. B. Smith, serving on the staff of
General Potter, was shot in the hand, and suffered amputation
of a finger.</p>

<p>Of the four divisions engaged the loss fell chiefly on ours,
the number of missing being very large. The official report
of casualties in the division was,&mdash;killed fifty-one; wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
two hundred and eighty; missing, one thousand three hundred
and thirteen. A large proportion of the missing were
from the First Brigade, as the regiments in its first line were
cut off by the enemy's flank movement, and nearly all of the
Fifty-first New York, and a large number of the Forty-fifth
Pennsylvania, and Fifty-eighth Massachusetts were captured.</p>

<p>The Second Brigade of our division first received the
shock of the evening's charge, and when it was seen that it
could not withstand it, the Seventh Rhode Island, in reserve,
was ordered to form a new line near the Pegram house, and
an order which, unfortunately, was not received by him, was
despatched to General Curtin to fall back to the line thus established.
If this movement had been made it is probable
that the heavy loss in the brigade would have been avoided.
Speculation as to the causes which occasioned this disaster
to our corps is, perhaps, unprofitable, and can afford but
little consolation; but one fact seems clear, that the delays
and blunders of general officers, rather than cowardice or
misconduct of the men fighting at the front, brought about the
mortifying result. The vexatious and apparently needless halt
after the first success of the Fifth Corps in the morning has
been alluded to. This gave the enemy time to reinforce his
threatened line, and the rebel commanders, thoroughly familiar
with the ground, had their customary advantage of being
able to direct their movements understandingly.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This action is called by the Confederates the battle of Jones' Farm. Lane's
North Carolina brigade formed the enemy's right; one of Wilcox's brigades the left,
with McRae's North Carolina brigade as a support. The latter, however, "rushed
forward to participate in the fight." See History of Lane's North Carolina Brigade,
in <cite>Southern Historical Society Papers</cite>, 1881, pp. 354-356.</p></div>

<p>During the night a storm began, and the day following was
one of the most dismal and uncomfortable ever experienced
by the regiment. No movement was attempted, but details
were employed in reversing the works behind which we were
bivouacked, so they might afford protection in case of an advance
by the enemy. The work was very difficult, as the
constant rain gave the freshly turned earth the consistency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of mud. The aspect of the men, as they painfully prodded
the moist ground with sticky shovels or crouched around
smoky and sputtering fires, was lugubrious in the extreme,
and their feelings corresponded with their looks. Occasional
shots were exchanged by the pickets, and one man of the
regiment, while sitting near a fire, was wounded by a stray
bullet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

AGAIN IN THE TRENCHES.</h2>


<p>The morning of October 2d was bright and clear, and the
lines were soon formed for an advance. We moved forward
about a quarter of a mile, to a point not far distant from the
Boisseau house, where we fell to in earnest and began the
construction of a line of works which were destined to be our
protection for many weeks.</p>

<p>We were greatly annoyed during the forenoon by a sharp-shooter,
evidently posted in a tree, and by the raking fire of
a battery, also screened by trees, which occasionally caused
a lively scattering by sending a shell whizzing diagonally
across our line. One of these burst in the ranks of Company
K, wounding three men and killing two; one of the killed
being Sergeant Daniel A. Burton. The fire from the battery
slackened in the afternoon, but the "reb" sharp-shooter
kept at work so persistently that it seemed extremely
desirable to put a stop to his fun. Accordingly, Colonel
Draper detailed James Knowlton, of Company E, and Corporal
Frank Bell, of Company F, two good shots, to relieve us
from this annoyance if possible.</p>

<p>They crept out some distance beyond the picket line,
found cover, and waited for indications. They had not long
to wait, for soon the crack of a rifle was heard, and from a
tree in the edge of the woods back of the enemy's picket line
rose a telltale puff of smoke. Both took careful aim, fired,
and to their delight saw a gray-clad Johnny come tumbling
heels over head out of the tree. The next morning the rebel
pickets told ours that the man shot was a lieutenant of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>sharp-shooters.
After this successful shot the work in the trenches
was pursued with more safety and peace of mind, and by
nightfall a strong rifle-pit stood between us and the enemy,
behind which we pitched our tents and sought repose with a
pleasant consciousness of being once more "in camp."</p>

<p>The day had been full of work and interest. The part of
the new line built by the Thirty-sixth was on open ground,
while the rebel position was masked by thick woods, and the
fire from unseen batteries and sharp-shooters was harassing
in the extreme. During the morning General Meade, accompanied
by a brilliant staff, passed along the line and halted
in the rear of the regiment, probably furnishing an additional
inducement to the rebel gunners to serve their pieces well.
In the evening Major Barker, Captain Fairbank, Captain
Burrage, and some of the men, went over the ground in front
of our lines, under cover of the darkness, and buried our
dead, whom the enemy had stripped of their clothing and left
where they fell.</p>

<p>October 3d passed more quietly. Shots were occasionally
fired on the picket line, but no hindrance was experienced in
the work of strengthening the fortifications, which was the
principal business of the day. Engineers were engaged in
laying out forts, two of which, named Fort Fisher and Fort
Welch, were in time completed, and formed a prominent
feature of the defences, as the line here made an angle, the
works to the left of these forts being the protection for the
extreme left of the army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>October 4th. Comparative quiet prevailed until the afternoon,
when there was a lively breeze on the picket line. In
our immediate front, and held by our pickets, was a deserted
house, to which reference has already been made, lately occupied
by Dr. Boisseau. As this house stood on rising ground,
and commanded a view of the enemy's line, it was surmised
that it might be made the object of an attack. In anticipation
of such an event, Captain Morse, with his company,
was, on the 3d instant, detailed as a reserve picket force, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
took up a position in a small rifle-pit near the house a short
distance to the rear of the picket line. The rebels had
during the day kept up a desultory fire, which made the
position of the few men stationed in the building somewhat
uncomfortable; but nothing unusual was noted until about
four o'clock, when the enemy attacked the picket line of the
Second New York, of our brigade. The capture of this line
let the enemy into the rear of the picket pits of the Thirty-Sixth,
and those adjacent to the house were precipitately
evacuated; but the reserve force held its ground until
convinced that the enemy was present in superior numbers,
when it fell back, leaving the house and a few men in his
possession. Our loss was four men captured,&mdash;Corporals
Charles Bottomley and George H. Mills, of Company C,
and privates Reuben Jackson and Lyman McDowell, of Company
E. Mills and Bottomley were shortly afterwards
paroled; but Jackson and McDowell were fated to swell the
ranks of that mighty army the story of which is sadly told
by the words, "Died in rebel prisons." The picket line was
at once reinforced, and the captured posts were retaken. A
second attack of the enemy was unsuccessful. After dark,
in accordance with orders, Captain Burrage, who was brigade
officer of the day, gave directions for the burning of the
building. It was soon a mass of flame, and presented a
brilliant spectacle, the weird effect being heightened by the
sharp crack of the rifles as the outposts on both sides blazed
away at random, each desirous to show to his antagonist that
he was not to be caught napping. At daylight on the morning
of the 5th the disputed property was a heap of ruins,
and our pickets who had been drawn back, on account of the
fire, took possession of their old pits without opposition.</p>

<p>We were now for several days kept busy in the construction
of earthworks, and the regimental camp was twice
moved; but by the 7th instant we were well settled, and were
made happy by the ever-welcome appearance of the paymaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>This day was also marked by the arrival of a new stand of
colors. The old flags, which in the wanderings of over two
years of active service had been borne in ten States of the
Union, and in both victory and defeat had been zealously
guarded as the emblems of our organization, State and National,
were now returned to the care of the Adjutant-General
of Massachusetts. Stained by the elements and blood,
and torn by shot and shell, with both staves shattered by
rebel bullets, they gave silent but faithful testimony to the
vicissitudes through which the men who followed them had
passed.</p>

<p>During this month an unexpected loss befell the regiment,
caused by the retirement from the service of Lieutenant-Colonel
Draper and Captain Morse, who left for home October
13th, to the great regret of their comrades of the Thirty-sixth,
whether officers or enlisted men. Although young men,
both were veteran officers of tried courage and recognized
ability, and we would gladly have retained them; but their
term of service had now expired, both having served in the
Twenty-fifth Massachusetts before entering the Thirty-sixth.
Lieutenant-Colonel Draper was soon after brevetted Colonel
and Brigadier-General "for gallant and meritorious service."</p>

<p>Major Barker succeeded to the command of the regiment,
and soon after received a commission as Lieutenant-Colonel,
dating from October 12th, 1864. The command of Company
C devolved upon First Lieutenant P. G. Woodward.</p>

<p>On the 14th inst. the regiment was for the first time in its
history ordered out to witness a military execution. The
condemned was a private of the Second Maryland, named
Merlin, who by the division court-martial, of which Lieutenant-Colonel
Draper was president, had been found guilty of
an attempt to desert to the enemy. The division was formed
in an open field on three sides of a square, in the centre of
which the doomed man was seated, blindfold, on a coffin
placed at the side of an open grave. Familiar with death as
the spectators were, it was an impressive scene as the firing de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>tail
silently drew up before the criminal, and at a preconcerted
signal (the dropping of a handkerchief) discharged a volley
which sent the soul of the deserter to its final account.</p>

<p>With the exception of the removal of the camp to a point
nearer the breastworks there was continued quiet until the
25th when rumors of a movement became rife, and toward
night orders were received to pack up and be ready to march
at dusk. We were soon in readiness, but the night passed
without the arrival of the expected order. The next day
brought additional indications of a contemplated movement
of considerable magnitude, and at one o'clock P.M. tents
were struck, and the regiment marched to a large field near
by, where, after participating in a brigade drill, it bivouacked
for the night. The time allowed for rest was brief, however,
as the sleeping soldiers were aroused at two o'clock on the
morning of the 27th. While we awaited in the darkness the
momentarily expected order to "Fall in," a mail arrived and
was distributed by the flickering light of the army candle,
and many a man as he read the welcome message from home
felt, as he thought of the morrow, that it might be for him
the last.</p>

<p>The movement in which the regiment was about to engage
we found to be one of great importance, from the
result of which much advantage to our arms was hoped.
General Grant, it appeared, had decided to make one more
attempt to turn the enemy's right flank, and, if possible, interrupt
his communications, before the weather should
become so bad as to render the roads impracticable for aggressive
warfare. A large part of the troops attached to the
Second, Fifth, and Ninth Corps were withdrawn from the
entrenched line for this purpose. The duty assigned to the
Fifth and Ninth Corps was to advance upon the extreme
right of the enemy's works, and capture them if possible,
thus turning his flank; while the Second Corps was to make
a detour to the west, cross Hatcher's Run in the vicinity of
Burgess' Mills, and operate against the Southside Railroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>At four o'clock we were on the road, and soon reaching the
left of our line marched through an opening made in the
works for our passage. The column then moved forward
over an uneven country, heavily wooded in parts, and quite
unfamiliar to the officers in command. The Fifth Corps
worked its way with difficulty to a position to the left of the
Ninth, and a general advance was attempted. The Third
Division (colored) of the Ninth Corps led in this movement,
and struck the enemy's line about two miles from our intrenchments.
The black men behaved admirably, driving
the rebels to the shelter of their fortifications, which were
found to be so formidable and well garrisoned that an escalade
was deemed unadvisable; and the position gained was
simply held, for a time, to await the result of the movement
to the left. The other divisions of the Ninth Corps remained
in support of the Third Division, and the regiment busied itself
during the day in throwing up a line of rifle-pits, behind
which it bivouacked at night. The night was rainy, and our
condition anything but comfortable, as we wearily waited for
the day.</p>

<p>The weather improved on the morning of the 28th, but,
instead of the anticipated assault, we found that preparations
were being made for the withdrawal of our forces, as it
transpired that the operations of the two corps on our left
had proved unsuccessful. Crawford's division, of the Fifth
Corps, had crossed Hatcher's Run, with the intention of gaining
a position behind the rebel right flank; but became separated
in the thick forest, and had remained all night in a
dangerous plight, but was fortunately withdrawn without
serious loss. The Second Corps had advanced, as directed,
to Burgess' Mills, where it was thrown into some confusion
by an assault of the enemy, from which it soon rallied and
drove back the assailants, capturing many prisoners, and,
although partial success was gained at this point, the evident
strength of the rebel forces made further offensive operations
unadvisable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Our division was ordered to retire about noon, and, in conjunction
with a division of the Fifth Corps, executed a very
pretty manœuvre. The troops of the Ninth Corps formed in
line of battle, leaving an opening through which those of the
Fifth passed by the flank; the latter then in turn formed in line
and in like manner guarded the passage to the rear of the other
column. The movement was conducted with the coolness and
regularity of a parade, notwithstanding the rattling fire of the
skirmishers, which furnished an exciting accompaniment.
After reaching our old line of defence we marched quietly
back to our lately abandoned camp, and reoccupied it.</p>

<p>Soon after the return from this unprofitable excursion the
regiment received a material addition to its strength by the
consolidation with it of the Twenty-first Battalion Massachusetts
Veteran Volunteers. This command was the remnant
made up of reënlisted men of the Twenty-first Regiment
Massachusetts Volunteers, and was justly proud of its long
and brilliant record. On account of the smallness of its
numbers it was ordered to join our larger force; but its veteran
members were naturally averse to the change, as by it
their old regiment lost its identity in a younger one; neither
did the men of the Thirty-sixth regard with favor the accession
of recruits in this wholesale manner, as their ten companies
were now compacted into seven, and their accustomed
formation lost. Military necessity is regardless of sentiment,
however, and the change was peacefully made, the new-comers
being pleasantly received; and they faithfully served with
the regiment until its departure for home, when they were
transferred to the Fifty-sixth Massachusetts Volunteers.</p>

<p>The following regimental order in reference to this consolidation
and organization was issued:&mdash;</p>

<p>Many of the officers were absent from the regiment, serving
in various capacities: Captain Hodgkins was A.C.M. Third
Division, Ninth A.C; Captain Smith, Provost Marshal, Second
Division, Ninth A.C; Captain Ames. A. Aide-de-camp,
First Brigade, Second Division, Ninth A.C; Captain Raymond,
Assistant Inspector General, Second Division, Ninth
A.C; Captain Davis, on detached service; Lieutenant Austin
Davis, on detached service, recruiting in Massachusetts;
Lieutenant Brigham, absent, sick at Annapolis, Md.</p>

<p>The uncertain and disagreeable weather, characteristic of a
Virginia winter, had now set in, and stormy days came with
such frequency that the more enterprising and active men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
began the work of "fixing up their tents." The experience
gained at Falmouth and Lenoir's Station was of value, now
that the erection of mud chimneys and log underpinnings
became a frequent occupation. The hospitality of the
thrifty ones who first became the happy owners of fireplaces
was often subjected to a severe strain, when their improvident
friends crowded in to view the improvements, and,
beguiled by the genial warmth, outstayed their welcome.</p>

<p>Little of severe duty fell to our lot at this period, the
work of picketing the front constituting the main employment;
and this was quite a peaceful pursuit when compared
with that of the summer, as there was no firing on the line,
and our relations with the enemy's outposts were generally
friendly.</p>

<p>This feeling of confidence, however, was broken, November
1st, by the capture of Captain Burrage. He was on duty
as brigade officer of the day, and his instructions allowed him
to exchange papers, if an opportunity offered,&mdash;an exchange
having taken place at this point almost daily for some time.
In visiting the picket posts, in company with the division
officer of the day, Captain Burrage found a rebel officer waiting
to exchange papers on a road which ran through the
woods where our division had suffered so severely September
30th. Leaving the division officer of the day, Captain Burrage
walked down the road and met the rebel officer. The latter
had with him three Richmond papers, and these Captain Burrage,
who had only a single Washington paper, received,
promising to bring out another paper in the afternoon.
Having made his rounds of the picket posts on our brigade
front, Captain Burrage carried the papers he had received to
General Curtin's head-quarters. On revisiting his lines, in
the afternoon, he learned that the rebel officer had not appeared.
After waiting a while, wishing to fulfil his promise even to an
enemy, he concluded to call some one out from the rebel line.
Unfolding the paper, and waving it in his hand, he walked
down the road to the point where he exchanged in the morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Then passing an angle in the wood he came in sight of the rebel
picket line, which was about fifty yards distant. Halting, and
still waving his paper, he saw a rebel soldier leave his post
as if to go for an officer. In a minute or two the soldiers
stood up in the rebel pits, levelled their muskets, and an
officer called out, "Come in, or we'll fire!" To attempt to
escape was useless, and Captain Burrage was compelled to
go in.</p>

<p>General Curtin at once gave orders to capture, in retaliation,
the first rebel officer found approaching our lines to exchange
papers. For a while the enemy made no efforts in
this direction; but, about a fortnight later, Roger A. Pryor,
formerly a General in the Confederate service, but now a courier
attached to General Lee's head-quarters, came over to
exchange papers near the place where Captain Burrage was
captured. A captain of the 11th New Hampshire, who had
not forgotten General Curtin's order, met him, and, drawing
his revolver on him, marched him into our lines. Pryor was
at once sent to Fort Lafayette, in New York harbor, and after
some negotiations, continued through several months, both
Captain Burrage and General Pryor were at length exchanged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

IN WINTER QUARTERS.</h2>


<p>During the latter part of November the Ninth Corps was
ordered to the right of the line to relieve the Second Corps,
which had been on duty in the trenches in front of Petersburg
since the movement of the Ninth Corps to the Weldon
Railroad, in August. On the 29th the brigade marched to
the vicinity of Hancock Station, on the military railroad, and
was assigned to the main line of trenches, the Thirty-sixth
being detailed for duty in Fort Rice as its permanent garrison.
Thus, after an absence of nearly three months, the
regiment was again on duty in the old line, a little to the
left of the position it occupied during the summer months.
Though in a new location all the scenes around us were familiar.
Immediately on our left stood the celebrated Fort
Sedgwick, better known in military histories as Fort "Hell,"&mdash;a
name given to it by the soldiers on account of its exposed
situation, which invited the fire of the enemy's artillery.
It was frequently subjected to terrific cannonading from the
guns opposite.</p>

<p>In front of us stood the grim batteries in the enemy's main
line of defence. The principal battery in that portion of the
line was in Fort Mahone,&mdash;called by the rebel soldiers Fort
"Damnation," for the same reason which won for Fort Sedgwick
its profane sobriquet. The brigade extended from Fort
Meikle on the right, held by the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts,
connecting with the left of the First Division, to Fort Davis,
about forty rods to the left of Fort Sedgwick, held by the
Seventeenth Vermont, Fifty-Sixth Massachusetts, and Thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>-first
Maine, which constituted the right of General Griffin's
(Second) brigade.</p>

<p>The principal duty devolving upon the regiment during
the winter was picket duty in the trenches. The picket line
was an intrenched work about one hundred and fifty yards in
front of the fort, and about the same distance from the rebel
picket line. Little of an exciting nature occurred during
the day, but at night the picket-firing was kept up by both
sides. There was more or less artillery firing from the main
lines on each side, the shells going over our heads. When
the enemy became aware of the change of troops in their
front, and the substitution of the Ninth Corps for the Second,
they supposed that the colored troops still belonged to the
Ninth Corps, and their firing was sharp and continuous; but
after being told that the colored regiments had been transferred
to another department they subsided into their usual
round of firing. At times the batteries indulged in lively
duels. Almost directly in front of the line occupied by the
regiment was a battery containing one or more eight-inch
columbiads, which threw its shells to a great distance in the
rear of our main lines, and annoyed the signal station at the
Avery house, the range of which they had obtained. In one of
the artillery duels our guns in Fort Sedgwick poured such a
fierce fire into this battery as not only effectually to silence
it, but finally, by a lucky shot, to burst the gun which had
caused so much trouble.</p>

<p>During the raid which General Warren made with the
Fifth Corps to Nottaway, in December, the regiment was
ordered to be in readiness to march, but was not withdrawn
from the fort; and again, in February, during the movement
to Hatcher's Run, it was expected that the regiment would
be ordered to the left; but the order to be prepared for
movement was not followed by orders to leave.</p>

<p>Now and then an incident transpired to enliven the spirits
of the men. On one occasion, after some days of extremely
cold weather, firewood became very scarce on the picket line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and one of our sergeants called out to the enemy that he proposed
to cut down a large tree which stood midway between
the picket lines. He accordingly went out, followed by five
men with axes; but before he could begin the work of chopping,
he was joined by a rebel lieutenant and four men with an
axe, who had come out for the same purpose. As each side
claimed the tree it was agreed that both parties should assist
in cutting it down, and then divide it as equally as possible.
The top fell toward the enemy's lines, and two men stood on
the trunk, back to back,&mdash;they who had stood so often face
to face,&mdash;and cut through the trunk, our men taking the butt
and the enemy the branches. That night the blaze of the
little fires in the rear of each picket line added to the comfort
of the men in their weary watches.</p>

<p>On the 31st of January a truce was declared during the
passage of Vice-President Stephens and the Peace Commissioners
from Petersburg to City Point. Many of the men
along the entire Petersburg front crossed the lines to "confer
with the enemy" in the peaceable exchange of coffee and
sugar for tobacco and such other commodities as the "Johnnies"
had.</p>

<p>During a portion of the month of January the regiment
was commanded by Captain Fairbank, in the absence on leave
of Lieutenant-Colonel Barker. Adjutant Haskell also received
a leave of absence, and some of the enlisted men were permitted
to go home on furlough.</p>

<p>Once or twice battalion drill was ordered on the open ground
in rear of the fort; but, as the enemy had perfect range of the
place, they did not propose to allow any show or parade in
force, and their well-directed shots rendered any exposure for
such a purpose impracticable.</p>

<p>Tidings of the steady and successful march of General
Sherman's army were frequently received, and information of
the capture of Fort Fisher, Wilmington, and Charleston was
communicated to the enemy in shotted salutes of one hundred
guns from all the batteries in the main line of works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the close of February there were many indications
that the enemy contemplated the evacuation of Petersburg,
and attempt a junction with the army of General Johnston in
North Carolina. Desertions from the troops along our front
became very frequent, and the statements made by these men
tended to arouse the apprehension of the commanding officers
lest the enemy should elude our grasp. The pickets were
kept constantly alert, and on dark and foggy nights scouts
were sent out to ascertain if any movement was being made
by the enemy. For the month succeeding the 25th of February
there were numerous indications of changes in the
enemy's position. These movements were accompanied with
much yelling and firing on the part of the confederates, and
whenever the scouts or skirmishers advanced they were followed
to our lines by large numbers of deserters. One night,
early in March, we saw the flames of an extensive fire in
Petersburg, and heard distinctly the ringing of the bells.
The reserves were under arms, and moved up to the main line,
prepared to follow any withdrawal of the enemy. After the
excitement had subsided the rebel pickets informed us that
the fire in the city was accidental. Thus week by week, and
month by month, the winter passed away, and the warmer
sun and opening ground and balmy air proclaimed the approach
of spring, that season for more active and exciting
work. Toward the middle of March enormous quantities of
supplies were forwarded to the left. The trains were loaded
with provisions, and the tops of cars covered with men returning
to their regiments from hospitals and convalescent
camps.</p>

<p>Old soldiers needed not to be reminded that an active
campaign would soon be inaugurated, and with the proverbial
instinct begotten of experience began that personal
preparation for effective work and rapid marching in selecting
what things to throw away. Inspections became more frequent
and exacting, and the fact of a speedy movement "was
in the air." Sutlers were ordered to City Point. The reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
division was moved to the left of Fort Davis, to stake out and
fortify a new defensive line covering the left and rear of the
Ninth-Corps line, and in a few days had a strong line of intrenchments.</p>

<p>While these preparations were in progress, in fact, while
the army of the Potomac was under marching orders, the
enemy suddenly and unexpectedly assumed the offensive.
On the night of the 24th of March, the day General Grant
issued his orders for a forward movement of his armies, a
strong force of the enemy, consisting of Gordon's corps and
Bushrod Johnson's division, the whole commanded by
General Gordon, was prepared for an attack on the right of
the Ninth Corps. Before daylight on the morning of the
25th three heavy columns of the enemy charged and captured
the main line on our right from Battery Nine to
Fort Haskell, including Fort Stedman, the principal work
in that portion of the line. The columns after reaching the
works charged to the right and left of the aperture, and advanced
a heavy line to the rear to seize the military railroad
and sever connections with City Point. By this time a
portion of the Third Division, under General Hartranft,
reached the scene of action, and attacked the enemy with
such vigor as to drive him into Fort Stedman and the
adjoining lines. With the reinforcements from this division
the troops on the right and left of the works held by the enemy
were enabled to form a line perpendicular to the main line,
and not only successfully resisted any attempt of the enemy
to advance, but confined him to that portion of the line already
occupied.</p>

<p>Preparations were at once made to retake the captured
line; and General Hartranft's division, by a gallant charge,
succeeded in reoccupying the works, and captured more than
nineteen hundred prisoners. While this movement was in
progress on the right, the troops of the Second and Fifth
Corps, on the left of the Ninth, attacked and captured the
enemy's strongly intrenched picket line in their front, gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>ing
very valuable ground, capturing nearly a thousand prisoners,
repelling several desperate attacks of the enemy
to recapture the works.</p>

<p>In the action at Fort Stedman the regiment was represented
by Captain Hodgkins, who was serving on the staff of
General Hartranft, commanding Third Division. It was an
action in which the Ninth Corps won deserved credit, exacting
from the enemy a bloody price for his temerity, and
fully avenging the disaster at the explosion of the mine
eight months before.</p>

<p>Comparative quiet was maintained by the enemy for a few
days following their repulse on the 25th. On the 27th
General Sheridan and the Cavalry Corps arrived in rear of
our lines, and moved to the left. On the 29th the surplus
artillery of the army of the Potomac, two hundred pieces,
was sent to the Ninth Corps, and the several corps designated
for the turning movement on the left moved out. The
operations of the army had begun on a grand scale.</p>

THE FINAL ASSAULT AT PETERSBURG.</h2>


<p>The enemy's works from the Appomattox to a point in
front of Fort Sedgwick were part of the old interior line
of defences. At this point the old line turned to the enemy's
right, forming an angle, but the works were continued
parallel with our front by a kind of spur, which diverged
from an old line and swept down toward Hatcher's Run.
The Ninth Corps fronted the whole of this old line to the
angle and about two miles of the spur. When the main
army moved to the left, on the 29th of March, the corps was
disposed so as to hold our front line to Fort Davis, and a
line of works running back from that point and covering our
left and rear. In other words our left was curved backward
into a fish-hook shape, and our position became isolated.</p>

<p>On the night of the 29th a considerable detail of the regiment
was sent out to level a disused parapet, some two or
three hundred yards in front of the fort. While at work
the men were startled at about ten o'clock by the sound of
rapid cannonading on the right. Looking toward the Appomattox
they saw the air filled with shells, the burning
fuses appearing like gigantic fireflies. It was an attractive
spectacle, and for a few moments the men leaned on their
spades and gazed; but as the firing ran rapidly down the
line, and mortar-batteries and pickets began to open in their
immediate front, there was a sudden and unanimous decision
that a view from the <em>inside</em> of the fort was not only preferable,
but of the most pressing importance. The regiment
turned out and took position in the fort ready for action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
but nothing occurred beyond the noise and a few casualties.</p>

<p>General Parke received orders on Thursday afternoon, the
30th, to assault the enemy's works at some point in his
front, at four o'clock, the following morning. The point of
attack was left to his discretion. He had already selected
the position in front of Fort "Hell" (Sedgwick), on the
Jerusalem Plank road, and at nightfall Hartranft's division
and Potter's division, except the Thirty-sixth and the other
regiments garrisoning the forts, were massed in rear of Fort
Sedgwick. Before midnight, however, orders were received
suspending the assault, the troops were returned to their
camps, and, although everything was constantly on the <i lang="la">qui
vive</i>, there was no movement for the ensuing two days.</p>

<p>Shortly before five o'clock on Saturday, the 1st of April,
General Parke received orders to assault at four o'clock the
next morning, and the same dispositions were made as before.
At ten minutes before ten in the evening came a telegram
from General Meade, directing Parke to open all his
artillery at once, push forward skirmishers, and follow them
up with columns of assault. Before the necessary arrangements
were completed these orders were modified by instructions
that the assault in force should be contingent on
developments of weakness on the part of the enemy. The
artillery opened, and the skirmishers demonstrated all along
the line. The enemy was found to be in force and everywhere
prepared except opposite the line between Forts Hays
and Howard, where Griffin's brigade of our division surprised
and captured two hundred and fifty pickets. The
original plan was accordingly adhered to, and preparations
for assaulting at four o'clock the next morning were made.</p>

<p>At three o'clock General Parke entered Fort Rice, and established
his head-quarters for the coming battle. Potter's
and Hartranft's divisions, and Harriman's brigade of Willcox's,&mdash;all
of which had been lying massed behind Fort Sedgwick
for two hours,&mdash;moved forward at the same hour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
formed a column between our main line and picket line.
The enemy's pickets were in close proximity to ours, but the
movement was executed so quietly as to give no warning to
them. The formation was in column of regiments. On the
right of the Jerusalem Plank road, its left resting on the
road, was Hartranft's division of Pennsylvanians, six regiments,
the Two hundred and seventh leading; the Two
hundredth and Two hundred and ninth were held in
reserve. On the right of Hartranft was a second column,
consisting of Harriman's brigade, of Willcox's division, five
regiments, with the Thirty-eighth Wisconsin leading, and the
Twenty-seventh Michigan and Thirty-seventh Wisconsin in
reserve. On the left of the Jerusalem Plank road, right
resting on the road, was a third column, our own division,
minus the Thirty-sixth and five other regiments which were
in the forts. Griffin's brigade, six regiments, led by the
One hundred and seventy-ninth New York, had the advance,
supported by our own brigade, Curtin's, with the
Thirty-ninth New Jersey in front, followed in order by the
Forty-eighth Pennsylvania, the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
and Fifty-eighth Massachusetts. At the head of each of
these three columns was a storming party, flanked by pioneers
with axes to cut away abatis, etc.; and a detail of one
hundred men from the First Connecticut Heavy Artillery
accompanied them to serve captured guns. Ely's brigade, of
Willcox's division, occupied our line from the Appomattox to
near Fort Morton, opposite the Crater, and the Fifty-first
Pennsylvania, of Harriman's brigade, was stretched along the
part of the line at the Crater vacated by its brigade on the
moving to the left to join in the main assault. To mislead
the enemy as to the real point of attack, these troops on the
right were ordered to make a strong demonstration at four
o'clock, which was to be followed by the advance of the
three columns along the Jerusalem Plank road.</p>

<p>Such was the situation in the trenches at Petersburg just
before dawn on that eventful April day. Only a few hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>dred
yards in our front, veiled partly by darkness and partly
by the morning mist, stood the grim fortifications which had
so long defied us that they had begun to seem impregnable.
Behind them lay the left wing of that army whose right had
been driven the day before, reeling and bleeding, from the field
of Five Forks. Upon the valor of this unscathed remnant
depended the salvation of Lee, and, knowing the quality of
that valor, there were few in Fort Rice whose hearts did not
beat anxiously for the columns in blue out there in front of
Fort Hell, silently awaiting the signal to advance. Along the
opposing line our chief of artillery counted ninety-one guns,
ranging from six-pounders to eight-inch columbiads (one of
which we remember as making some very poor practice at our
signal station in the rear of Fort Rice), and thirty-five mortars,
from Coehorns to ten-inch. Against them we had four
four and one-half inch Parrotts, eleven thirty-pounder Parrotts,
forty-two light twelve-pounders, thirty-four three-inch
Rodmans, four ten-inch, fourteen eight-inch, and twenty-two
Coehorn mortars,&mdash;in all ninety-one guns and forty mortars.
Just what troops were in our front it is impossible to tell.
The prisoners brought into Fort Rice during the day were
Alabamians; and a rebel colonel, who was interviewed at
Farmville by a member of the Thirty-sixth, said he commanded
an Alabama brigade occupying the line opposite Fort Rice.
The salient opposite us (Miller's or Reeves') appears to have
been manned by a battery from Mobile. Our old friends of
the Thirty-fourth Virginia (Bushrod Johnson's division)
were relieved several days before the assault, and were at
Five Forks. The difficulty is that the rebels made no
official reports of the closing engagements of the war, and
such unofficial accounts as are accessible are meagre in
details.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the artillery opened and fired vigorously
for several minutes. Then Willcox made his demonstrations
on the right. The Fifty-first Pennsylvania captured some of
the pickets at the Crater, and Ely's brigade carried about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
hundred yards of the enemy's main line; but were finally
compelled to fall back. At half-past four the main attack
began. The columns moved at quick time and very little
cheering. The picket line was broken instantly. As we
stood at the parapet in Fort Rice, peering into the mist, we
could see little or nothing of the assault; but we could hear
the blows of the pioneers' axes on the <i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i>, and the
shouts of command. The musketry fire of the enemy increased,
and following the flash of their cannon we could distinguish the
"whish" of the double charges of canister. Presently new
sounds came over the field. Exultant Yankee cheers told us
our boys were inside the works. Then we heard short, sharp
summons to surrender, coupled with epithets and rifle-shots,
as the "Johnnies" took the chances of flight. The first gray-back
we saw was a short, jaunty chap, who trudged across
the field, toward the fort, alone and quite unconcerned, passed
through a little gap in the abatis, climbed the parapet, and,
coolly bidding us good-morning, asked if we had some hard
bread and coffee. As he sat in the bomb-proof and regaled
himself he told us he belonged to a Mobile battery in position
opposite us, and that when he heard the Yanks coming he
prudently retired to the magazine, only to emerge after his
battery had been cleaned out, and the Yanks were in full
possession. Afterward a considerable party of prisoners
were brought in,&mdash;Alabamians, a sullen, indomitable-looking
crowd, boasting of how they would have whipped us if
they had had nearer our numbers. The captures in this
charge were twelve guns and eight hundred prisoners.
Describing the assault, General Parke says in his official
report:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The stormers and pioneers rushed on, and under a most
galling fire cut away and made openings in the enemy's abatis
and <i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i>. They, now closely followed by the assaulting
columns, which, undeterred by an exceedingly severe
fire of cannon, mortar, and musketry from the now aroused
main line, pressed gallantly on, capturing the enemy's works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
in their front. Colonel Harriman's column, reinforced by the
two reserve regiments, swept up to the right until the whole
of what was called by the enemy 'Miller's salient' was in our
possession. Potter's column swept down to the left. This
part of the enemy's line was heavily traversed, affording him
a strong foothold, and he fought from traverse to traverse with
great tenacity. We drove him slowly back for about a quarter
of a mile, when, being reinforced and aided by strong
positions in the rear, he checked our further progress in that
direction. A most gallant, but unsuccessful, attempt was
made to carry his rear line. The captured guns were at once
turned upon the enemy, served at first by Infantry volunteers,
and then by details from the First Connecticut Heavy Artillery
volunteers from the batteries in the rear.</p>

<p>"Just after we broke through the enemy's lines, and at a
most critical time, I was deprived of the valuable services of
Brevet Major-General Potter, who was severely and dangerously
wounded. I directed Brigadier-General S. G. Griffin
to assume command of his division, and by him the division
was ably and gallantly commanded during the rest of the
day. It being by this time fully daylight, no further
attempt was made to advance; but attention was turned to
securing what we had gained, and restoring the organization
of the troops, unavoidably much shattered by the
heavy fighting and the advance over broken ground in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"This was rendered the more difficult by the great loss we
had sustained in officers, especially field officers, and by the
very exposed position occupied by our troops. The captured
line was promptly recovered, and made tenable as possible,
the difficulty being increased by the forts and batteries on
that line being open in the rear.</p>

<p>"By reason of these untoward circumstances much time
elapsed before I considered the troops in sufficiently good
shape for another forward movement, and in the meantime I
received, at 7.30 A.M., the following despatch:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p class="right">

</p>

<p>"'<em>Maj. Gen. Parke</em>,&mdash;General Meade sends for information the
following from the Lieut. Gen.</p>

<p>"'As I understand it, Parke is attacking the main line of works
around Petersburg, whilst the others are only attacking an outer
line which the enemy might give up without giving up Petersburg.
Parke should either advance rapidly, or cover his men and hold all
he gets.</p>

<p class="right">
'ALEX. S. WEBB,<br />

</p>

<p>"At 7.45 I received the following despatch:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
"'<span class="smcap">Head-quarters Army Potomac</span>,<br />

</p>

<p class="right">

<em>Bvt. Maj. Gen. and Chief of Staff</em>.'<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>"About this time the enemy made an attempt to get up a
charge on us, but our fire was so hot that they did not get
many men outside their lines.</p>

<p>"We then held a distance of about four hundred yards on
each side of the Jerusalem Plank road, including several
forts and redans. The enemy made no further movements,
with the exception of being very busy, planting more guns,
and keeping up an incessant and murderous fire of sharp-shooters,
until just before eleven o'clock, when he made a heavy
and determined assault on the captured line; but we repulsed
him at all points, with much loss. It being evident to me
that the enemy was resolved to regain, at all hazards, the
portion of their lines held by us, and nearly all my reserve
being in, and learning from General Wright that he was
moving toward Hatcher's Run, leaving a wide gap between
us, I deemed it advisable to report the state of affairs to
army head-quarters, and request reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"The request was promptly complied with, and Benham's
and Collis' brigade from City Point, and Hamlin's brigade
of the Sixth Corps, were ordered to my support. The enemy
continued to make heavy and desperate attempts to recapture
his lost works, but without success. But, though my men
stood up nobly to their work, this long and wearisome struggle
was beginning to tell upon them."</p>

<p>At about three P.M. the enemy succeeded in regaining a few
of the traverses on the left, which gave them a flank fire upon
a small detached work on the left of Plank road, held by one
of the regiments of Curtin's brigade, and occasioned its temporary
abandonment; but, General Collis reporting to me
with his brigade about this time, I at once put him in under
direction of General Griffin, and the enemy was again driven
from the portion of the line he had just retaken.</p>

<p>Between four and five o'clock P.M. General Hamlin arrived,
with his brigade from the Sixth Corps, and I directed him
to report to General Hartranft, by whom he was placed in
support of the left of his line. These reinforcements having
rendered my line secure I was disposed to make another effort
to drive the enemy from his position in the rear, but the
exhausted condition of my troops forced me to reluctantly
abandon the idea.</p>

<p>"We accordingly strengthened ourselves as much as possible,
whenever practicable transferring the enemy's <i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i>
to the front of the reversed line and on the right, connecting
by a cross-line the extreme point we held with our
main line."</p>

<p>General Hartranft speaks in his report of three rebel
charges to retake the works,&mdash;one at quarter past eleven
A.M., one at five minutes past one P.M., and one at three
P.M. These charges were delivered from the line of works in
the rear of and commanding the captured line. The assault at
three o'clock was in plain view from Fort Rice, and seemed
to us the most formidable. Collis' brigade, consisting of
the Sixty-eighth and One hundred and fourteenth Pennsyl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>vania,
the Twentieth New York State Militia, and the
Sixty-first Massachusetts, was just going up to the line,
when the rebels emerged from their works and came on
with such steadiness and determination that a portion of our
line wavered, as we could plainly see, and many men broke
precipitately to the rear. Collis' line appeared to waver too,
as if undetermined whether to go forward to the line or fall
back. It was a critical moment. General Parke and his
staff watched, with evident anxiety. All day long the boys
had laid along that line under a galling fire from front and
flank. A heavy mortar, planted at our right, between the
enemy's first and second line, in a pit fifteen or twenty feet
deep, as we afterward discovered, had kept up a fatal practice
upon them in spite of all our gunners' efforts to silence it.
Traverse by traverse they had driven the "Johnnies" down the
line, paying for every foot of ground with their blood; and
now it looked as if all might be lost. But no! Where one
man quailed, a dozen stood undaunted, answering the rebel
yell with Yankee cheers and bullet. We saw some of our
color-bearers leap upon the works and wave the flags. It
was like an inspiration. The line became firm. Collis' brigade
wavered but for a moment, and then swept forward
magnificently and opened fire. The gallant Connecticut
Heavies, who were serving the guns in the captured works,
stuck to business unflinchingly, only piling in the canister
a little faster when the infantry line showed signs of weakening.
There was a mighty cheer as we saw the column of
gray break and surge back whence it came. We could
hardly have been more exultant, indeed, had we known
then that the last armed rebel we were destined to behold
had disappeared forever from our view.</p>

<p>Although the Thirty-sixth took no active part in this
engagement, as a regiment, many of the men performed laborious
and dangerous service in carrying ammunition up to
the captured line. Major Raymond, of General Potter's
staff, Major Hodgkins, of General Hartranft's, and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Ames, of General Curtin's, were of course actively engaged.
As a matter of general interest, a tabular statement of the
losses in the corps are appended:&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

CLOSING SCENES.</h2>


<p>Heavy skirmishing was kept up during the night along the
Ninth-Corps line, and the batteries on our right opened at
short intervals, according to orders. The regiments of our
brigade which had borne the brunt of the fighting the day
before were relieved, and returned to their former positions
in the main line about midnight. The evacuation of Petersburg
was anticipated, and General Parke instructed the troops
to exercise the greatest vigilance, in order to detect at the
earliest possible moment any movement of the enemy.
Soon after midnight the skirmishers advanced, but found the
enemy's pickets still out in strong force. Explosions occurred
in the city, and all indications pointed to a speedy retreat.</p>

<p>After an anxious, wakeful night to the garrison of Fort
Rice, the morning of the 3d of April dawned clear and
beautiful. With the first approach of day the troops in
front advanced, found the enemy's works deserted save by a
few pickets, who were captured, and pushed forward toward
the city only to find that it had already been abandoned.
The first sound that greeted our ears was the glad cry, "Our
flag waves over Petersburg!" It was, indeed, true. The
sound of battle had died away. The enemy, who had withstood
our advance for so many months, had vanished from
our view. Ely's brigade of the First Division was the first
to enter Petersburg. The formal surrender was made to
Colonel Ely at twenty-eight minutes past four A.M., and the
flag of the Second Michigan was hoisted over the Court-House.
Great cheering followed, which was renewed later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
by the receipt of the glorious tidings that our army was in
possession of Richmond, and that the enemy was in full retreat.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight the troops returned from the city to
their former positions, to prepare for a forward movement.
Orders were received to break camp, and be ready to march
at a moment's notice. Haversacks were filled, and everything
was prepared for an immediate advance. Never were marching
orders more cheerfully obeyed. The day, for which we
had toiled, and fought, and prayed so long, had dawned upon
us, and few, indeed, of that garrison resisted the impulse to
ascribe all the glory to the God of battles. Soon after sunrise
the regiment partook of its last breakfast in the bomb-proofs
of Fort Rice, which had been its home for four months.
At nine o'clock orders were received to move in the direction
of Petersburg, and in a short time the command moved over
the breastworks, across the picket line, through the enemy's
defences which had been the scene of the sanguinary battle
of the day before, and marched to Cemetery Hill, where
a halt was ordered. While resting here a cavalcade approached.
It was the escort of Abraham Lincoln, President of
the United States. As the men recognized Mr. Lincoln their
enthusiasm could not be restrained, and amid the thundering
cheers which he graciously acknowledged, the President rode
on toward the city, where he received a grand ovation.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock the column marched into the city, by the
main street, and we were soon surrounded by the colored
people, who gave expression to their joy in tears and smiles
and shouts of welcome. Hundreds of children thronged
around the soldiers, and many asked for bread, which was
freely given to them by the happy men. Many of the soldiers
divided their substance with the poor whites remaining in the
town, and one of our men was seen feeding five little children
at one time with the rations which he carried, leaving him a
short supply for the next three days. We were soon informed
that the reason of this keen desire for food was owing
to the fact that for some time previous the price of flour had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
been $1,050 a barrel! At such a price, with scarcity of
Confederate scrip, it is not to be wondered at that many
poor people were made happy at the sight and taste of bread.</p>

<p>At noon the corps was concentrated in the city proper.
The remainder of the Army of the Potomac, without even
entering the city which it had besieged for ten weary months,
had hurried westward, to intercept the retreating enemy, and
was marching on the river road. General Parke was ordered
to leave one division to guard Petersburg and the railroad,
and move with the rest of his corps, as guard for the
wagon-trains, on the Cox road. At one o'clock the preparations
were completed, and the Second and Third Divisions
resumed the march, the Second having the right, leaving the
First Division to guard the city. About a mile and a half
west of the city the road forks: the northern road (nearest
the Appomattox) being called the river road; the southern,
which runs parallel with the Southside Railroad and crosses it
many times, being called the Cox road. Just west of Sutherland
Station, where Sheridan's force struck the railroad, the
river road forks, the southern fork being known as the Namozine
road, named from the stream whose course it follows.
The regiment marched all the afternoon, and at night bivouacked
beyond Sutherland Station, twelve miles from Petersburg,
on the Southside Railroad. Generals Grant and
Meade slept there that night.</p>

<p>On the 4th the march was resumed. The roads were badly
cut up, and the enormous trains, with the reserve artillery,
moved slowly, rendering the march difficult and tedious.
The country improved in appearance as we advanced westward.
The peach-trees were in full blossom, and everything
about us tended to inspire hope and courage. We passed
several hospitals filled with the enemy's wounded, and during
the day many rebel prisoners passed to our rear <i lang="fr">en route</i> for
Petersburg under guard. Nearly all of them were worn down
with hard fighting and hunger, and many were fed from the
commissary supply train. At night the regiment bivouacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
near Beasley's,&mdash;a great tobacco plantation,&mdash;about twenty-five
miles from Petersburg, the division occupying a line
seventeen miles in extent, covering an extended front, and
picketing all the roads leading south.</p>

<p>On the 5th the march was resumed. The movement was
from left to right, covering the entire line of road occupied
by the moving trains. The division on the left of the line
moved first to the right, and extended the line in that direction,
covering the Southside Railroad. At night the regiment
bivouacked at Black's and White's Station, thirty-five miles
from Petersburg. On the sixth, at noon, the regiment left
camp and marched ten miles, to Nottaway Court-house, where
corps head-quarters had been established. Here the regiment
was detailed to guard a supply train to army head-quarters,
which were supposed to be at or near Jetersville, a station
on the Richmond and Danville Railroad, about fifteen miles
north of Nottaway Court-house. We marched all night over
a rough road, and reached Jetersville at eight o'clock, on the
morning of the 7th, to find that army head-quarters had moved
during the night to High Bridge, on the Southside Railroad,
and were still some fifteen miles in advance of us.</p>

<p>After a short halt, for the men to make coffee and the teams
to be fed, we moved forward, following the line of the Danville
Railroad in the direction of Burkesville. Arriving within
five miles of the latter place, our direction was again changed
to the north-west, and the regiment proceeded across the country
to Rice's Station, on the Southside Railroad, which place
was reached about eight o'clock on the morning of the 8th.
The regiment had now been marching two days and nights in
search of army head-quarters, without sleep, having halted
for refreshment but twice since leaving Black's and White's, and
then only long enough to make coffee. At Rice's Station the
regiment was relieved from further guard duty with the train,
and went into camp. In the meantime the remainder of the
brigade had moved forward to Burkesville, about eight miles
in our rear. A despatch was at once sent to General Cur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>tin,
commanding the brigade, informing him of our position,
and asking for orders; in reply to which we received orders
to proceed to Farmville, ten miles in advance, on the Southside
Railroad, and relieve the provost-guard at that place.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th, the regiment marched to
Farmville, a town situated on the Appomattox river, five
miles west of High Bridge, and fifteen miles north-west of
Burkesville. We reached this place about noon. The regiment
was at once detailed as provost-guard, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Barker was appointed provost-marshal. The town
contained a population of about two thousand; and here we
found a large number of wounded Confederate soldiers, and
many prisoners captured in the movement to this place a day
or two before. The troops relieved by our regiment moved
westward, to join their commands in the pursuit of Lee's
army. This was the ever memorable day when, at half-past
three o'clock in the afternoon, General Lee, at Appomattox
Court-House, twenty miles distant, surrendered the remnant
of the army of Northern Virginia to General Grant.</p>

<p>Intelligence of the surrender was quickly transmitted to
head-quarters, and no pen can portray the effect upon the
men as the glorious news spread from camp to camp like a
conflagration. Men who in the stern hour of battle had been
unmoved and undaunted; in gloom and disaster cheerful
and hopeful; in hunger, privation, weariness, and sickness
calm and unruffled,&mdash;now shouted and wept in turns like
children, and gave expression to their feelings in yells of delight.
The goal had at length been won; the trials and
hardships and sufferings of weary years had culminated in
victory. Some of the men of our regiment, on duty at the
church, entered it for the purpose of ringing the bell, but
could find no bell-rope. Not to be baffled in his purpose,
Michael Sullivan, of Company F, climbed up through a scuttle-hole
over the gallery, and found a ladder under the seats, by
which he ascended into the belfry. There remained about
six inches of rope attached to the tongue of the bell, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
he seized and struck with all his force, his head meanwhile
being inside the bell. He rang the bell as long as his strength
would permit, and its joyful peal was heard with astonishment
by the town's people, and great delight by the troops. At
night bonfires were blazing everywhere, and a long time
elapsed before quiet was restored.</p>

<p>The next day the remainder of the brigade moved to
Farmville, and encamped south-west of the town. General
Curtin was assigned to duty as post commander. Division
and corps head-quarters remained at Burkesville. Lieutenant-Colonel
Barker, as provost-marshal, established his head-quarters
in a large building formerly used as a store, situated
on the main street, in the central part of the town. The
regiment was quartered in the town, and furnished safeguards
of from one to five men to protect the property of the
citizens in various places in the surrounding country. Guard
duty in the town was also performed by the regiment. The
duty was arduous and wearisome, as it included not only the
regular guard duty, but the labor of issuing rations to the
impoverished citizens, who poured into the town from all directions
for food. A careful record was preserved of all to
whom relief was afforded, with the quantity of rations issued
to each, involving a vast amount of clerical labor. In addition
to this duty paroles were made out for all the Confederate
prisoners found in the place, and for hundreds of others
who came to the village from Appomattox Court-House.
During the stay of the regiment at this place the following
number of Confederate soldiers were paroled by the provost-marshal:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Saturday, April 15th, Captain Henry S. Burrage, who
had been absent since November 1st, when he was captured
in front of Petersburg, returned to the regiment, and on the
following day he was appointed Acting Assistant Adjutant-General
on General Curtin's staff. Late in the afternoon of
that day a telegram was received from Washington, announcing
the assassination of President Lincoln. At first this
information was regarded as a hoax or a camp rumor; but all
doubt was soon banished, and the sad intelligence was confirmed
in the formal announcement of his death by General
Meade.</p>

<p>The sad intelligence cast a shadow of gloom over the entire
nation; but nowhere was the sorrow more profound than
among the soldiers of the army of the Potomac. The closing
days of that wonderful life had been spent in its camps, and
within sound of some of its last terrible battles. The heart
almost crushed by the burden of responsibility and care, borne
throughout the long years of war, had been lightened and
cheered by its glorious victories, and the men were bound to
him by ties of admiration and affection. The general sorrow
which pervaded the army was shared by the citizens of Virginia.
They felt that the South had lost its best friend, and while they
appreciated and applauded the magnanimity of General Grant,
now that the war was virtually ended, they relied upon the
warm heart of the President to inaugurate measures for
reconstruction which should unite the hearts of the people of
the North and the South. Nowhere was this feeling more
general than among the people of Farmville. As soon as the
death of the President was formally announced the Mayor, in
accordance with the generally expressed wish of the citizens,
convened the Common Council, and the following official action
was taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

<span class="smcap">Town Hall, Farmville, Va.</span>, April 18th, 1865.<br />
</p>

<p>A called meeting of the Common Council of Farmville was held
this day at Town Hall.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
<p>The object of the meeting being explained, and an official communication
from General Curtin, commanding this post, having
been read, announcing the death by assassination of President
Abraham Lincoln, and the orders of the General commanding this
department as to the proper observance of the day of the funeral
obsequies of the late President, the following action was taken:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That the Common Council of the Town of Farmville
have heard with profound regret the tragic fate of the late President
of the United States; that we regard the event as a great
national calamity, particularly and especially to the South; and
while we deplore the country's loss, we at the same time feel the
warmest sympathy for the family whose head has been so suddenly
and ruthlessly hurried into eternity.</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That we cordially approve and will conform to the
order of the Commanding General in the proper observance of the
day of the burial of the late President, and recommend to the
citizens suspension of all business operations, and unite in the
common hope that this afflictive dispensation of Providence may
not impede the restoration of peace and happiness to our country.</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, That a copy of these resolutions be furnished
General Curtin, commanding post.</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) W. W. H. THACKSTON, <em>Mayor</em>.</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">J. H. Mottley</span>, <em>Clerk</em>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The day following (April 19th) being the day appointed
for the funeral obsequies of the lamented President at the
national capital, in accordance with general orders from the
commanding General, all unnecessary labor was suspended.
It was a day of sadness in the camps, though the sun shone
brightly and the songs of birds filled the air. In the afternoon
a memorial service was held in the Presbyterian church,
which was very largely attended by the citizens and soldiers,
and a memorial discourse was delivered by Rev. Mr. Severance,
of Farmville. As the congregation sat in reverent
attitude, listening to the solemn music and the words of
prayer and eulogy, it was hard to realize that the beloved
President had indeed finished the work of life. We remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>bered
him then as we had seen him on that triumphant
morning, only sixteen days before, when, in response to our
thundering cheers, the careworn face was lighted with joyful
smiles as he rode into the city which the victorious army of
the Potomac had won.</p>

<p>Now a whole nation was in tears. In one short week it
had been plunged from the summit of happiness into the
valley of mourning. Flags, lately mast-head high in every
breeze, were trailing, and joyful hearts were in sorrow at the
great calamity which had befallen the nation. Nowhere was
Lincoln more beloved and honored than in the army, and
nowhere that day were there deeper expressions of sincere
and poignant grief.</p>

<p>On the 21st of April our stay at Farmville came to a sudden
end, upon the receipt of orders to march to Petersburg
and City Point. The brigade, with the exception of the
Thirty-sixth, had marched the day before. At half-past
seven A.M. the regiment left Farmville and marched, <em>via</em>
Rice's Station, to Burkesville, where we arrived at four P.M.
Here we received the gratifying intelligence that the remainder
of the journey was to be made in cars, and not on
foot. A train was soon in readiness, and at eight o'clock
P.M. we left Burkesville, and, at a rate not exceeding five
miles an hour, proceeded to City Point, which place was
reached at four o'clock on the morning of the 22d. As the
journey was made direct, passing through Petersburg in the
night by rail, we had no opportunity of looking again upon
the scenes of our battles and hardships for ten weary months.
It would have been gratifying had we been permitted to survey
the scene of the battles in June, the crater and the lines
of earthworks, undisturbed and in security from the deadly
bullet; but it was destined that our latest recollection of that
war-scarred ground should be associated with the scenes of
strife and carnage.</p>

<p>Upon reaching City Point the regiment went into camp not
far from the landing, to await the arrival of the remainder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
the brigade, which was marching by the highway. On the
24th, at noon, the brigade arrived, and went into camp near
by, and on the 26th, at ten o'clock at night, we went on board
the steamer "Vidette," and lay at the wharf until daylight,
when we steamed down the James river, past historic scenes,
reaching Fortress Monroe at two P.M. The journey was
continued, and Alexandria was reached at noon of the 28th.
The brigade marched through Alexandria in column of
companies, and proceeded to the high ground beyond the
city, in front of Fort Lyon, where we found, in a comfortable
camp, that portion of the corps which had preceded us.</p>

<p>On the 30th, Private James Dolligan, of Company K, one
of the men transferred from the Twenty-first, was instantly
killed, while sitting in his tent, by the careless firing of some
colored troops, who were discharging their pieces near by.
This was the last casualty in the regiment.</p>

<p>Camp-life near Alexandria was comparatively easy and
pleasant. Many of the restraints of the service were removed,
although the discipline was fully maintained. The
men were allowed more personal liberty; many were permitted
to visit Washington, and many others availed themselves
of the opportunity of visiting Mount Vernon, which,
throughout the war, had been regarded as sacred ground,
and had not been molested by either Confederate or Union
troops.</p>

<p>Occasionally the camps were brilliantly illuminated at
night. On the night of the 12th of May an unusual scene
was witnessed in a torchlight parade. The men had carefully
saved all the candles that could be obtained. These were
placed in the muzzles of their guns, the muskets being used
as torches. After forming in line of battle many evolutions
were executed, and the various movements presented a novel
and beautiful spectacle to all beholders.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May the long-expected and eagerly awaited
orders were received from the War Department for the
speedy muster-out of all regiments whose term of service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
should expire before October 1st. Preparations for this
happy event began immediately. Soon the camp was in a
state of busy excitement. Cracker-boxes and barrel-heads
were converted into use as tables, and all the camp-writers
were busily engaged in preparing muster-out rolls and
discharge papers.</p>

<p>This agreeable employment was interrupted temporarily
by orders to proceed to Washington, and participate in
the grand reviews of the army of the Potomac and the
West. Early on the morning of the 22d of May the regiment,
with the entire corps, proceeded in light marching
order to Washington, and bivouacked for the night on the
open ground east of the capitol. On the morning of the
23d the men were astir early, preparing for the review.
The Ninth Corps followed the cavalry, having the right of
the column of infantry. The corps marched in column of
companies at half distance, with a front of eighteen files.
The First Division, constituting the garrison of the defences
of Washington, had the extreme right, and was followed by
the Second and Third Divisions, with their respective
brigades, in numerical order. The day was superb. Not
a cloud obscured the sun, and none who marched in the
ranks of the veteran and victorious army of the Potomac
on that brilliant day will ever forget the splendid pageant.</p>

<p>The infantry, being in light marching order, presented a
fine appearance. The men were dressed in their best, wore
white gloves, and nearly all carried bouquets in the muzzles
of their guns. The tattered, blood-stained banners were
garlanded with flowers, and many of the officers' horses wore
brilliant wreaths. Great preparation had been made for
this magnificent pageant. Stands for spectators had been
erected at every convenient spot, and the great crowds in
attendance were excited to the highest pitch of enthusiasm
by the martial display. Thousands of school-children sang
patriotic songs and showered bouquets of flowers as the
column passed. At the White House great stands had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
erected on both sides of the avenue, and at this point, amid
immense cheering and the thunder of artillery, the army
passed in review before President Johnson, the leading
Generals, and the Governors of the States. Here one face
was missing. Here all that seemed wanting to complete the
sense of triumph was the form of Abraham Lincoln, at whose
call these veterans had left their homes in defence of their
country, and who, since the close of the fighting, had been
called to his reward. Recollections of him, and the memory
of comrades who had fallen rushed upon us. Our feelings
found fitting expression in the language of Brownell's
poem:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">

<span class="i0">The ranks of our faithful dead<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>
<p>For more than six hours the march continued through the
streets of Washington, amid scenes as magnificent as those
when the armies of Rome carried their victorious eagles
through the streets of the Eternal City. After passing in
review, the regiment continued its march through Georgetown,
and at night occupied its regular camp.</p>

<p>After this all was bustle and activity in preparation for our
muster-out and return home. Day after day the air was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
filled with the music, and cheers, and good-byes of the troops
who had been mustered-out, as they left their comrades in
battle and the scenes of war, to go to their homes and engage
in the pursuits of peaceful life. Reviews and parades were
substituted for guard duty and drill. On the 3d of June,
the anniversary of the terrible day at Cold Harbor, General
Parke reviewed the Second Division, and on the 5th General
Curtin, temporarily in command of General Hartranft's
division, was tendered a complimentary review by the regiments
of his old (First) brigade. This was the last parade
of this veteran brigade, and elicited the following commendation
from General Curtin:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<em>To the Officers and Men of the First Brigade, Second Division,
Ninth Army Corps</em>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>I desire to express to you, one and all, my heartfelt appreciation
of the kindly feelings which prompted the review of last evening.
On that occasion your appearance was as gratifying to me as
honorable to yourselves. In your movements you exhibited that
true soldierly bearing which, on the field and in the camp, has ever
distinguished the soldiers of this brigade. In the Carolinas, in
Maryland, in Kentucky, in Mississippi, in Tennessee, and in Virginia,
your valor and heroic endurance have won for you an imperishable
name. Victory has at length crowned your efforts, and
the efforts of the brave men associated with you.</p>

<p>In parting with you who are about to repair to your homes allow
me to express my sincere thanks for the prompt and cheerful
manner in which you have at all times performed every duty while
under my command. To those of you who remain allow me to say,
be patient. I trust the day is not far distant when it will be
practicable for you, also, to return to your homes. Until that day
arrives let your bearing be such as not to detract from, but to add to,
your present well-earned reputation. As you go to your homes
you will bear with you the proud consciousness of duty successfully
performed, and will receive from your countrymen the applause
of a grateful people; while in all the years to come, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
you revert to the scenes now so rapidly closing, it will be your
pride to say, "I fought with Burnside and the Ninth Army Corps,"
and there will be associated with all this your part in the history
of the First Brigade, Second Division.</p>

<p>To the families and friends of your comrades, who have so nobly
fallen in the defence of their country, I tender my heartfelt sympathy.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 6th all preparations for muster-out having been
completed, orders were received for the regiment to be in
readiness to depart on the following day. That evening the
regiment organized a torchlight procession, and, escorted
by the brigade band, marched to the camp of our comrades
of the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania. It was the last time these
organizations, which had been so intimately associated since
September, 1862, were to meet as regiments. During the
entire term of the Thirty-sixth, through all the vicissitudes
of its service, this gallant regiment of Pennsylvanians had
never been separated from it; and in every battle in which
we had been engaged we had felt their strong support upon
our right or left.</p>

<p>After a season of fraternal conversation Colonel Gregg, of
the Forty-fifth, delivered the following address:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<em>Officers and Men of the Thirty-sixth Massachusetts Volunteers</em>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>"Nearly three years of toil and blood have passed since our
first acquaintance with you. Thinned in numbers, we had
then just left the victorious fields of South Mountain and
Antietam. From that day to the present&mdash;in camp, on
the toilsome march, and in the conflict of battle&mdash;you have
stood side by side with us, contending for our country
against treason and oppression. Your record is one of
which the glorious old Bay State may well be proud; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
we are sure she will ever count your organization one of
the noblest she has sent to the field.</p>

<p>"Amid scenes of conflict we have learned to love and honor
you; and as the blood of our heroes has there mingled
together, so have our hearts been united in one fraternal
bond of union, which time cannot sever. With the brave
men of the Thirty-sixth by our side, we were always sure
of hearty support and final victory; each vied with the other
in deeds of valor and trials of endurance, and both shared
equally the honors won.</p>

<p>"Together we have thus fought, together we have rejoiced
and wept,&mdash;rejoiced at the success of our united arms, wept
for the fallen brave around us.</p>

<p>"Now all is changed. The white-winged messenger of
Peace beckons us from scenes of conflict to once more resume
the avocations of industry and domestic tranquillity.
You are about to leave us and return to your homes in the
old Bay State. We have met probably for the last time.
Here, under the folds of our colors, let us strengthen these
feelings of love and affection which have so closely united
our destinies in the field. Let us, also, in remembrance of
our comrades who have so nobly fallen, and whose memory
we will always cherish, pledge ourselves anew to the flag
and the country we love.</p>

<p>"Brave and faithful sons of Massachusetts, the victory is
won! Return to your homes, and, as you recount the valor
of your arms, say that the Keystone boys of the Forty-fifth,
sons of your ancient sires, defended with you the liberties of
our fathers assailed by rebellion and wrong.</p>

<p>"Comrades of the Thirty-sixth, we bid you an affectionate
farewell!"</p></div>

<p>This address was received with great applause. Appropriate
responses were made by members of the Thirty-sixth;
and we returned, late at night, with the conviction that we
bore with us the esteem and affection of that gallant regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>On the march back to their quarters the regiment halted
at the camp of each regiment of the brigade, and exchanged
farewell cheers and greetings with our comrades, who were
to remain in the service yet a little longer.</p>

<p>On the eighth of June, in accordance with orders, the
recruits and the Twenty-first men were transferred to the
Fifty-sixth Massachusetts, and the regiment was mustered-out
of the service of the United States by Lieutenant Rose,
division mustering-officer. At three o'clock P.M., escorted
by the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania, Colonel Gregg, and the
brigade band, we marched to Alexandria. The Forty-fifth
had made special preparations for this parade. All the non-commissioned
officers carried small American flags on their
bayonets, and the regiment presented a splendid appearance.
At Alexandria we bade our comrades good-by with cheers,
and embarked for Washington. After considerable delay at
the latter place cars were loaded with the troops and baggage,
and the homeward journey commenced. Many delays
and discomforts attended this journey; but they were all
borne with a spirit of equanimity and resignation, because
we knew this to be the last excursion of the kind we should
ever make. Philadelphia was reached at noon of the 9th,
and the regiment enjoyed the hospitality of the city at the
famous Cooper Shop refreshment-rooms, receiving a warm
greeting, and obtaining abundant cheer, and much-needed
rest. Late in the afternoon the journey was resumed. New
York was reached during the night, and the regiment
marched to the battery, where quarters were provided.
The next day, about noon, the regiment took the cars
on the Shore line. Soon we were within the limits of the
dear old mother Commonwealth, and on the evening of the
10th we arrived at Readville, where we pitched our tents
for the last time. During the following day, Sunday,
many friends and former comrades visited the camp, and
warm welcomes were extended. On Monday, the 12th,
Company B received an ovation from the citizens of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Charlestown, and on Tuesday, the 13th, the entire regiment
visited the city of Worcester, and received a most hearty
and generous public greeting. The little band of bronzed
and hardy veterans presented a strange contrast to that
regiment of more than one thousand men, who, nearly three
years before, had marched the same streets on the journey
to the front; but the reception compensated for these
years of toil and hardship.</p>

<p>The following account of the reception is taken from the
"Worcester Spy" of June 14:&mdash;</p>

<h3>RECEPTION OF THE THIRTY-SIXTH REGIMENT.</h3>

<p>The Thirty-sixth Massachusetts Regiment, Colonel T. L. Barker,
arrived in this city yesterday, and were formally received and
welcomed home by the city authorities in the afternoon. The
State Guard, Captain Fitch, and Captain Chamberlain's Company
of State Militia, with Goddard and Riedle's band, performed
escort duty. The line was formed on Front street, and the procession,
accompanied by the city government and a large number
of past officers who have been in the service from this city,
marched down Main street and countermarched to Mechanics'
hall, where the formal reception took place, and the returned
veterans partook of a collation provided by Hudson, under the
direction of the city government.</p>

<p>Many of the buildings on Main street were decorated with the
national colors, and flags were flying in all directions. The returned
soldiers were welcomed with hearty cheers along the line
of march, and on entering the hall were greeted with waving of
handkerchiefs and prolonged applause by the crowd of ladies that
filled the galleries. After the veterans and their escort had taken
their places at the tables, His Honor Mayor Ball addressed the
regiment as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<em>Officers and Soldiers of the Thirty-sixth Regiment</em>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;We are assembled to congratulate you upon
your auspicious return from the field of conflict, honor, and danger
which has witnessed your daring, your valor, and your heroism,
for the past three years. Now we see, consummated in your re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>turn,
the ardent longing of your hearts when you left us. In this
we share with you your joy. Joy, that you should have been preserved
to return once more to enjoy the blessings and humanities
of civil life, the fruits of your labors. For the honorable part you
have borne in the great civil war, accept our acknowledgments of
high appreciation of the noble service you have rendered a noble
and just cause. Allow us to share with you some of your intense
joy at the victories, in achieving which you have borne such a
memorable part. In these victories we have rejoiced, as the pealing
bell, the booming cannon, and the glaring bonfire have attested.
These have been our oratory and have furnished our eloquence.
At your success our joy has been too deep for human speech, and
our elation too excited to be bounded or measured by mere human
speech. We know this to be your joy, and in its realization we
congratulate you most cordially, most earnestly; and here we
welcome you, in behalf of the city, to this hospitality, in token of
our appreciation of the high service you have rendered the city, the
State, and the country. We welcome you cordially again to the
bosom of civil life. With you we rejoice again in the return of so
many of you safe from the perils of the camp and the battle-field
to your homes and your friends. With you we join in your sorrow
for the noble and the brave that you have left on the battle-field.
Their eyes longed to see this hour,&mdash;a privilege they have been
denied. You have been blessed in the seeing, and with you we
will honor their names and respect their memories. We welcome
you again to the pursuits of civil life, where victories attend activity,
resolution, and energy, as well as in the exciting scenes and
service of the camp; and we rejoice with you that you have aided
in giving a new meaning to the dear old flag, in whose defence
you have endured so much. Be it ours to cherish it evermore with
vastly more increased love than ever we did before. Great is our
rejoicing that yours is the memory of that great day when Richmond
fell. Proud may you be of the recollection of that mighty event;
and long may the years remain to you in which to enjoy the peace
of your labors; and may we all be one in purpose and aim, hero
and civilian, to rightfully cherish these memories, and to use, with
pure motives, these blessings vouchsafed to us by kind and
indulgent Heaven, through your valor, your sufferings, your
patriotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The divine blessing was then invoked by Rev. Nathaniel Richardson,
Chaplain of the Thirty-sixth, after which the company did
ample justice to the collation. During the repast Mr. C. C.
Starring performed upon the organ a variety of national and
patriotic music, and a quartette of male voices from Dale Hospital,
members of the Warren Phalanx of Charlestown (Company B),
gave two patriotic songs, which were warmly applauded.</p>

<p>At the close of the repast, in behalf of the regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith returned thanks to the city authorities for the
courtesies and welcome extended to them. He said it was a proud
day for American soldiers, and a proud day for the Thirty-sixth to
return and to receive the approbation of the city from which they
went away three years ago to fight the battles of the Republic.
When we then left this city we received our flag from the ladies
of Worcester, and our commander pledged himself and us that it
should be honorably defended and returned. He has long since
left us; but the promise was binding, and to-day we return it without
dishonor. We count it a matter of pride that in all our arduous
service and on many hard-fought fields the Thirty-sixth Regiment
has never lost a color or a flag.</p>

<p>On account of the lateness of the hour the speech-making was
abbreviated; and after the soldiers had cheered for the mayor, the
ladies, and the citizens of Worcester, and the spectators had given
nine hearty cheers for the Thirty-sixth Regiment, the assembly
dispersed.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the officers who have returned with
the regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Monday, June 19th, at four o'clock P.M., the regiment
assembled at Readville, was paid in full, and discharged
from the service of the United States, and its record in the
suppression of the Great Rebellion passed into history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>This narrative of the prominent events in the campaigns
of the regiment, its enrolment, journeys, marches, battles,
camps, and final discharge, conveys but little idea of its
interior history, the associations of its members with each
other, the routine of army life, and the daily experience of
the individual soldier. All this is a portion of that unwritten
history impressed indelibly upon the memory of the surviving
members.</p>

<p>A spirit of fraternity and good-will pervaded the regiment
throughout its term of service. It was a compact, homogeneous
body of men, remarkably free from envy, strife, and
jealousy. It came into the service under the second call for
three hundred thousand men for three years. The early enthusiasm,
caused by the breaking out of the war, had in a
measure subsided. The military service was known to be
arduous, dangerous, and severe. Hardship, hunger, disease,
battle, and death must be confronted, and this very fact was
the inspiration of the hour. Men knew that the war was
likely to continue for the full term of their enlistment. The
regiment was composed of good material. While there were
many men above the age of thirty-five, and many even above
the age of forty-five, yet the number of young men was so
largely in excess of these that the average age of the entire
regiment was hardly twenty-four years.</p>

<p>It was composed, in the main, of men of good moral
character. But few were addicted to the vice of intemperance.
The hard-earned pay was carefully husbanded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
sent to those who needed it at home. Not an officer or man
was dismissed the service, or dishonorably discharged; not
an officer or man was court-martialled. The high standard
of moral character was due doubtless, in a great degree, to
the influence of home; but the example of many men of
strong religious character, prominent among whom were
Orderly Sergeant White and the lamented Sergeant Merrick,
had much to do in maintaining the tone of morality. All
the vacancies existing among the commissioned officers were
filled by promotion from the rank and file. After the
muster-in, in 1862, not a commission, excepting to a chaplain,
was issued to a person outside the regiment, nor was
there an appointment made from civil life. Officers and
enlisted men of the Thirty-sixth were commissioned in other
regiments, and many others, of all grades, were detailed to
various positions of trust and responsibility in the several
divisions and corps of the army. As we recall the names of
those who received appointments to honorable positions in
other organizations we cannot fail to remember and claim
the following-named as our own: Captain Prescott and
Lieutenants Gird and Tucker were commissioned in the
Fifty-seventh Massachusetts. Prescott as Major, and Gird
as Captain sealed their devotion with their lives,&mdash;the first
in the Crater, the second in the Wilderness. Tucker rose to
the command of his regiment, after receiving fearful wounds,
which hastened his death. Private Swords of Company B,
was commissioned Captain, was wounded at North Anna,
captured at Fort Stedman, and brevetted Major. Lieutenant
Levi N. Smith, of Company D, was called to a position
of great responsibility in the Commissary Department at
army head-quarters, and was brevetted Colonel for efficient
services. Sergeant Brown, of Company B,&mdash;one of the first
of the Color Sergeants,&mdash;was commissioned Captain in the
Twelfth Kentucky, and won a medal of honor for gallantry
at Franklin, Tennessee. Private Snell, of Company E, and
Corporals Benjamin Edmands and Chapman, of Company B,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
were commissioned Lieutenants in different regiments of
colored troops, and rendered gallant service. The first
served upon the staff of General Crawford; the second won
a good name in South Carolina; and the third was killed in
the great explosion at Mobile, on the very day of our muster-out
of service, leaving the record of a gallant and faithful
soldier. These are treasured as a part of the contribution of
the regiment to the cause of Freedom in other organizations.</p>

<p>Nor do we forget the many brave and faithful men, as
worthy as any of these, who served their entire term without
any of the honors and privileges conferred by rank: Sergeants,
capable of commanding companies, who were wounded in
battle, and unable to rejoin their comrades in the field; or
were, in some cases, commissioned, but not able to avail
themselves of the rank on account of the reduced number of
men in their companies and consequent inability to muster;
or, as in the case of others, mustered-out of service as supernumerary
Sergeants by reason of consolidation and transfers,
and others equally brave and trusted, who toiled, and labored,
and fought in the ranks with no incentive but a desire to
render their full measure of loyal service, and who made a
record of which they and their comrades may well be proud.</p>

<p>The associations born of common suffering and danger, and
cemented by battle-blood, have continued and strengthened
with the lapse of time. Soon after the war a Regimental
Association was formed, which bears the name of "The Burnside
Association of the Thirty-sixth Regiment, Massachusetts
Volunteers." General Burnside, then Governor of Rhode
Island, acknowledged the receipt of an invitation to attend one
of its reunions in the following characteristic letter:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smcap">State of Rhode Island, Executive Department,<br />
Providence</span>, Dec. 4, 1866.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sirs</span>:&mdash;I am more than sorry not to be able to attend
the meeting of your Association to-morrow. The occasion would
be interesting to me, not only as the anniversary of the raising of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
the siege of Knoxville, but as a reunion with my old comrades of
the Thirty-sixth. You know what good reasons I have for honoring
your gallant regiment. It served in the Ninth Corps from its
first arrival in the field until the close of the war, and made for
itself a record second to none in the service. The affection in
which I hold all its surviving members, and the reverence with
which I cherish the memory of the departed, have been begotten
by a long and pleasant acquaintance in the field as comrades in
arms. My best wishes and prayers will follow you through life.</p>

<p>For the honor conferred upon me by calling your Association
after my name, please accept my warmest thanks.</p>

<p>With the hope that I may have opportunities of meeting you at
some of your future anniversaries, and with the wish that you may
have a most joyful reunion, I remain, sincerely your friend,</p>

<p class="right">
A. E. BURNSIDE.<br />

<p>The Annual Reunions of the regiment, held at Worcester
on the 2d of September, the anniversary of the departure of
the Thirty-sixth for the seat of war, have always been largely
attended, and the sons of the dead and the living comrades
have been admitted to membership, and participate in these
seasons of festivity and cheer. At all these gatherings we
recall the memories of those who went forth with us never to
return.</p>

<p class="center">ROSTER AND RECORD<br />
OF THE<br />
THIRTY-SIXTH REGIMENT OF INFANTRY,<br />
MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEERS,<br />
1862-65.
</p>


<p>The roster of commissioned officers contains the names and, as
far as can be ascertained, the full military record of all who were
commissioned in the Thirty-sixth Regiment, and the officers transferred
to it from the Twenty-first Regiment. The record of the
enlisted men is based upon the original muster-in rolls of the
regiment by companies, as appeared on the 27th of August, 1862,
the day the regiment was mustered into the service of the United
States. The names of recruits have been added to the companies
into which they were mustered. The record accounts for those
only who were enlisted for the Thirty-sixth Regiment. The names
of the men of the Twenty-first and Twenty-ninth regiments appear
in the histories of their respective regiments. The roster and
record have been carefully compared with the rolls in the office of
the Adjutant General, who has furnished every facility in obtaining
as complete a record as it is now possible to make.</p>

<p>Private Israel H. Smith, of Company C, the sole survivor
of ten members of the regiment captured at Rutledge,
Tenn., soon after the raising of the Siege of Knoxville, has
furnished the substance of the following brief narrative of
the circumstances attending the capture and the sufferings
endured by himself and the brave comrades who did not
survive the hardships and cruelty attending their confinement.</p>

<p>While the regiment was encamped at Rutledge, East
Tennessee, during the pursuit of Longstreet, after the Siege
of Knoxville, Smith, with nine other members of the
Thirty-sixth, and a small detail from the Forty-fifth Pennsylvania,
under charge of Sergeant Charles H. Boswell, of the
Thirty-sixth, were ordered out on a foraging expedition,
the regiment being greatly in need of subsistence supplies.
While out for this purpose they took possession of an old
mill about four miles from camp. The detail of the Thirty-sixth
was composed of Sergeant Charles H. Boswell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Privates Daniel H. Park, Lucius A. Reynolds, Frederick
Ruth, and Israel H. Smith, of Company C; Hezekiah
Aldrich, Calvin Hubbard, and Patrick Gillespie, of Company
G; and Charles H. Howe, of Company I. These
men were in the mill grinding corn, their rifles stacked in
one corner, when, early in the morning of December 15, a
boy came running into the mill saying that the rebels were
approaching. Smith glanced out of the window and saw a
squadron of men whom he supposed from their dress to be
Federal Cavalry, but it afterwards appeared that their blue
uniforms had been taken from one of our supply trains
captured a day or two before. They numbered about four
hundred, and immediately surrounding the mill they demanded
a surrender. Resistance being hopeless, our men
broke their rifle-stocks and gave themselves up to the rebel
band, which proved to be a detachment of bushwhackers
under General Wheeler. After the surrender the rebels
threatened to shoot their prisoners if they did not give up
their valuables. They took from them everything, money,
rings, watches, keepsakes, and then forced them to give up
their clothing, receiving for it in return the old clothes of the
rebels. They were then taken about two miles from the mill
and turned into an open field, where they spent the night,
without shelter of any kind, the rain pouring in torrents.
No fires could be made, and the night was one of great suffering.</p>

<p>The next day was extremely cold, and they were obliged
to march without covering to their feet, over the rough,
frozen roads to Rogersville, a distance of nearly thirty miles.
Here they were turned into an old brick building. The next
morning, the second after their capture, Smith received one
biscuit and a small piece of maggoty bacon. They were
then marched twenty-five miles to Bristol, on the line of the
Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, and put on board the cars
and taken <em>via</em> Petersburg to Richmond. Here they were
placed in an old tobacco warehouse, called Pemberton Castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
The first food given them was hailed with delight. When
first seen some of the men remarked that it appeared to be
well seasoned with pepper, but a closer inspection showed
what was supposed to be whole pepper was, in reality, small
bugs, and the dish was termed "bug" soup.</p>

<p>Smith remained in this place one week, and was then
sent to Belle Isle. Here, though snow lay on the ground, he
had no shelter. During the day he made himself as comfortable
as possible on the sunny side of a bank. At night he
was obliged to walk nearly all the time to keep from freezing.
He remained on the island until March 10, 1864, when he
was sent to Andersonville.</p>

<p>Here he was summoned before the notorious Captain Wirz,
who recorded his name, company, and regiment, at the same
time cursing him because he came from Massachusetts. He
was then marched into the Stockade, and placed in the
Fourth detachment. His daily rations consisted of one pint
of coarse meal and corn-cob, ground together, with a
spoonful of pea-beans occasionally. His shelter was a hole
in the ground. Without soap or towel or comb, or change
of clothing, with nothing to read, and surrounded by all the
depressing scenes of that dreadful place, he soon became ill,
and was scarcely able to help himself; while his comrades
wasted away to skeletons and died before his eyes.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November, 1864, after spending nearly a
year in Southern prison pens, Smith was paroled at Savannah,
Ga., and sent to Annapolis, where he was placed in the hospital,
and remained until he was mustered-out of service.
All the members of the regiment who were captured with
him died of disease in rebel prisons.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
